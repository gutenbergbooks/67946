<p class="dropcap">Chickamauga Creek had no place
on the map until September, ’63.
Then it ran blood and became history.
For it takes blood to make history.</p>

<p>When Bragg went to pieces two months
later, after the shambles of Missionary
Ridge, Hooker’s Corps was the pack
turned loose to harry him out of the valley.
They rushed thoughtlessly—Hooker’s
hounds always did—and the foremost
quickly paid the tax which Rashness
pays to Reason. Cleburne, the rebel
general, who brought up the rear of
Bragg’s army, turned, wolf-like, at a gap
in the mountains and cut to pieces the
hound that had outstripped the pack in
its zeal to snap at harried haunches.
The hound whimpered and fell back, but
not before Cleburne had shingled the
sides of the mountain with the dead of
the Yankee army.</p>

<p>The General who claimed the cut-up
regiment was mad, and as he rode, with
his staff, to the front, he was swearing
in a deep, jerky, guttural voice. He
stopped to look at the bloody gap, the
lusty, voiceless, blue-coated forms, lying
so weirdly unnatural—as trees when the
hurricane has passed: “Mountain gaps—they
are little traps of hell,” he kept
repeating, and he spurred on for a guide—to
a cracker cabin higher up on the
mountain side.</p>

<p>The General rode a clean-limbed, loosely-ribbed,
long-back thoroughbred, fresh
from a blue grass paddock in Middle
Tennessee. For he was weak on horse-flesh,
and had impressed this scion of a
Derby winner before Rosecrans went
North.</p>

<p>Two mountaineers stood in the cabin
yard. One was middle-aged, sullen-eyed
and stooped, but standing six feet with
the stoop. He leaned on an unmounted
axe-helm, and as he stood slouching,
long armed, bowed in the legs, his hairy
chest gleaming through open shirt front,
he looked not unlike a great gorilla,
brought to bay with uprooted club in
his hands.</p>

<p>The other man was not much more
than a boy, except in size. He was
larger, bigger chested, bigger fisted, and
his wonder-haunted, kindly face wore a
smile instead of a scowl. Never before
had he seen the flag which one of the
officers carried. Never such a horse as
the one ridden by the man in front—never
such a horse, and how he did love
horses!</p>

<p>But the thoroughbred shied at the sight
of the bearded man and sprang sideways,
snorting, and wheeled to run. The boy’s
face broke over in a quizzical, familiar
grin, and he drawled exultantly:</p>

<p>“Say, Mister, whut yo ridin’ there?”
The man turned sullenly and knocked
him down with the axe-helm. He
went down helplessly and with a subdued
surprise in his blue eyes. The man
did not turn his body, but stood indifferently,
watching him slowly arising,
wiping the blood from his forehead and
whimpering like a struck cub:</p>

<p>“Ef mammy hadn’t tuck an’ went an’
died—I promised mammy I’d nurver
strike ye, dad.” He blew the blood from
his nose and stood scratching one leg
with the bare foot of the other, whimpering
still, and dazed.</p>

<p>“Solomon Hosea Hanks, ye’re a blatherin’
yearlin’ an’ ’ll allers be one. Ain’t
I knocked ye down often fur buttin’ in
ye horns befo’ ye’re axed up to the
trough?”</p>

<p>He was talking to the boy, but saying
it for the men in front: “Gentlemen,
’light an’ look at yer saddles. I’m jes
teachin’ the lad some manners—you hafter
teach ’em to some folks with a
club.”</p>

<p>The boy suddenly straightened up.
Half defiantly, and with quick eagerness,
he leaped across the path where sat the
color-bearer. He stopped beneath the
flag and began to fondle it as a child
would—the pretty stars, the gold cord
that fell from the eagle above: “Ye’ll
nurver knock me down ag’in, Dad. Ye’re
a g’erriller an’ ye know it, an’ ye wanter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
make me one, but I’ve seen my country’s
colors to-day an’ I’m goin’ ter jine.”</p>

<p>He turned to the group: “I know whut
you want, Mister-men, an’ I’ll lead you
over the mount’in ef you’ll let me jine.
’Taint uverbody I’ll let knock me down”—he
wagged his head at the man with
whimpering apology—“promised mammy
afo’ she tuck an’ went an’ died I’d nurver
strike him”—</p>

<p>A rattling volley of shots rang out
across the mountain, down in the next
valley. They were echoed back, then
shouts, and when the General wheeled,
the boy had struck out toward the firing,
his tough, bare feet crounching the gravel
as he strode on in his shambling way.
They followed him, but could not overtake
the long, swinging trot in the
crooked path amid the boulders and clay
roots. On a projection beyond the ridge
he stopped, calling back to the man:</p>

<p>“Far’well, Dad—you’ll nurver see me
aga’in onless I hear you’ve beat little
Dinah Mariah—then I’ll come back an’
forgit I urver had a mammy.” He shook
his great fist at the man still standing
immovable, then: “Come on, Mister-men—Bragg’s
a good dog, but Holdfas’ is
better.”</p>

<p>And that is how Solomon came into the
camp of the Tenth.</p>

<p>He led them to the firing line, where
the General suddenly found plenty to do.
So much that he forgot Solomon until
the brigade went into camp five miles
further, on the trail of the retreating
enemy. Then Solomon staggered in
through the darkness to the camp fire
carrying a half dead Confederate on
his back. He laid the man down on a
bed of leaves near the mess tent of the
Tenth. He lifted the helpless head very
tenderly and gave him water while the
stricken one kept whispering, “Water—more
water—for God’s sake—and death!”</p>

<p>The staff had been laughing and swearing
before, with tin cups full of mountain
whisky. For they were tired, and
death had sprung up so often and so
suddenly that day from batteries and
trenches and mountain gorges; and from
still, restful copses of silent woods, peaceful
and inviting, until—Spit! Spit!—and
the rattlesnake of sharp-shooting rifles
spat out the virus which had put comrades
and mess-mates to sleep. But now
the silence and the night fell from the
deep treetops together. That dying man
in the camp, that strange, solemn giant
of the woods—</p>

<p>The General, his tin cup half emptied,
spoke first, in a voice strangely soft,
the staff thought, for the old fighter:</p>

<p>“Any kin to you, Solomon—the man
there?”</p>

<p>“He’s mighty nigh to me—mighty
nigh.”</p>

<p>“Ah—sorry—sorry. And who is he?”</p>

<p>“Jes’ my brother, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, too bad—sorry—sorry”—and the
staff muttered the echo.</p>

<p>Then the General put down his cup,
went over and glanced at the man. He
stepped back quickly and hastily drained
the tin cup: “Nasty fix, Solomon—sorry—but
we’ll do what we can for him.
When did you see him last?”</p>

<p>“Nurver seed him befo’—but thar’s
hund’erds of ’em—all our brothers, ’specially
when we’ve shot ’em an’ they’re
helpless an’ dyin’.”</p>

<p>The General winced and turned quickly
to the fire. The staff went after another
drink. Solomon’s eye fell on the mess
table—the supper set forth and waiting;
then Solomon fell on the supper. Between
mouthfuls he growled out:</p>

<p>“You fellers orter be ashamed o’ yerselves
to shoot a man’s innards out like
that. I found him three miles beyant
the mount’in whar you-uns fit thar this
mornin’ an’ I fetch’t him over on my
back.”</p>

<p>That reminded him. He picked up
some hardtack and bacon and started
toward the groaning man. Then he
stopped, disappointed: “Whut’s the use—he’s
got no whur to put it. You-uns
done shot his innards out. The fust
lickin’ Dad gin me was fur shootin’ a
b’ar in ther innards.”</p>

<p>He sat down again and ate everything
in sight. The General and staff got busy
at something else. Solomon gave the
dying man another drink and began looking
around like a huge bear-dog for a
spot to roll up on, and sleep. He found
it in the General’s blanket, his huge feet
sticking out, bunion covered and black.
They thought he was asleep and coming
quietly back one by one, sat down, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
were eating in silence when a shock of
hair blurred up out of the blanket:</p>

<p>“Say, Mister-men, but ain’t war hell
sho’ nuff? But tell the boys not to shoot
ther Innards out—’taint fair.” Then he
slept.</p>

<p>The General waited till he heard him
snoring: “Major, if you happen to lose
him to-morrow in the first skirmish—really,
I don’t think we need him, Major?”
The Major was sure they did not—so
were the others.</p>

<p>They made the dying man as comfortable
as they could, the General sparing
his own warm rain-coat for the limbs
now rapidly chilling. But his groans
kept them awake: “Water—water—oh,
God—water and death—kill me, somebody!”</p>

<p>The cry fell out of the silence with
the starlight, mingling strangely with
the shivering wail of a screech owl—so
uncannily mingling that they seemed
as one.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when the General
saw the foot withdrawn, the big
form arise and slouch over to the dying
man: “Water—water—and, oh, for God’s
sake—have mercy and kill me.”</p>

<p>Solomon tenderly lifted the gasping
lips to the canteen: “Do yo’ means it—want
me to kill ye sho’ nuff, brother?”</p>

<p>The man’s eyes were beseeching as he
gasped: “I——can’t——live——death
every——minute——put me——out
of misery—God will——reward you.”</p>

<p>Solomon’s eyes were wet with tears.
His great pitying heart thumped loudly:
“How, brother? Whut with?”</p>

<p>The dying man nodded at a bayonetted
rifle near by: “That——push that——through
my heart——quick!”</p>

<p>The General arose just in time. Solomon,
with a strange sob in his throat,
stood over the man, the gun poised,
the bayonet’s point—</p>

<p>“My God, Solomon!”—and he grasped
the descending gun by the barrel. “This
is murder—I’ll have you shot!” The
giant turned on him astonished: “He
cyant live—you-uns shot him to pieces.
That’s war. I put him out o’ his misery—that’s
murder. Strange—strange!
Brother,” he stooped and whispered regretfully
to the man, who beseeched him
with fixed, unwinking eyes, “Brother, I’d
do it—God knows I’d like ter ’commodate
yer, but ye heurn yo’self.” Still lower:
“But say, brother, ef you fin’ ye cyant
stan’ it no longer—when they sleep—call
Solomon—an’ I’ll sho’ ’commodate
you in this. God bless ye.”</p>

<p>Later there was a rigid stiffening and
gasps among the leaves and Solomon
knew there was no need for his bayonet.</p>

<p>The next morning when the General
arose, Solomon had fed and rubbed down
Ajax, the thoroughbred. He stood talking
to himself—he had forgotten the
war: “Whut a hoss—whut legs—whut
muscles, like bees a swarming! I’ve
allers dreamed o’ keerin’ fur sech!” He
turned to the General: “I’ll take keer o’
him from now on.” The General was
touched and when he shook Solomon’s
hand the bond was sealed.</p>

<p>“How long have you been up, Solomon?”</p>

<p>“Two hours b’ day—Gen’l.” It was
the first time he had used the word and
the old fighter inwardly scored one more
point for the horse—that could prune the
pride of the mountaineer—he who knew
no titles, no superior.</p>

<p>“Ye see, Gen’l, forgot yistiddy to kiss
Dinah Mariah good-bye. She’s the little
deef-mute mammy lef’ befo’ she tuck an’
went an’ died. I raised her—gi’n her
urver rappin she had ’cep the milk she
drunk, an’ wish’t I c’ud er gi’n her that.
Dad’s been so tarnel mean to her. D’ye
know I had an idee that he wanted ter
put her out o’ the way? So I steps back
over the mount’in an into the cabin whur
they all sleeps—all ’leven on ’em. But
ye know I couldn’t kiss ’er good-bye,
seein’ ’er sleepin’ thar so sweet?” He
struck savagely at his eyes with his big-knuckled
fist. “But I fetched this—I’ve
jined fur the war an’ I wants my own
gun—don’t like ther blunderbusses you-uns
shoots. This un’s a Deckerd—been
thro’ ther Revolushun, an’ with Ole Hickory
at New ’leans. It’s fittin’ fur it to
fit ag’in fur the Union. Thar—see!” and
he pointed the gun high up at the limb
of a big oak.</p>

<p>The General saw nothing until the
great flint and steel snapped together
like the jaws of an alligator, and he had
a tender but headless fox squirrel for
his breakfast, cooked, later, by Solomon’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
own hand. “An’ I don’t shoot ther innards
out, nurther,” he growled.</p>

<p>“You needn’t lose him, Major,” chuckled
the general, as he pulled off a succulent
hind limb, roasted on a green stick-spittle
over a pit of coals. The Major
having the mate of it in his own mouth,
could not speak, but nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>A hard winter and deadly fighting between
Missionary Ridge and Atlanta:
but Solomon enlivened it for the Tenth.
For he was their brother and his quaint
sayings became their intellectual stock
in trade. For instance: “The —— Iowa
flickered at Dug’s Creek. Then they
sulked.” They had done it before. “What
shall I do with them?” snarled the General
that night in camp. Solomon
drawled in:</p>

<p>“’Pint ’em ter bury ther dead—they’re
nat’ul born pallbearers. I’ve seed lots
o’ folks that was.”</p>

<p>When old Tecumseh Sherman heard
of this he offered to promote Solomon to
a corporalcy:</p>

<p>“Nun—no,” said Solomon, “then I’d
hafter wear boots an’ a unerform. An’
say, them thar unerforms you-uns wear
meks you-uns look jes lak them little
flyin’ stink-ants that swarms out in the
spring. God didn’t inten’ no two fol’ks
ter be alike. Es fur boots, they fus’ jes
make yer feet tender an’ then wears out.
I’ve got on a pa’r thet nurver wears out.”</p>

<p>He figured next in a horse race with
a Kentucky regiment which was first
unwise enough to cast aspersions on the
speed of Ajax and then bold enough to
back them with the long green. It was
a great race run between two lines of
howling blue. “Nurver bet agin natur’,”
said Solomon dryly, as he pocketed all
the money of the Republic which the
unwise Kentuckians had. “Ajax is by
natur’ a horse an’ your’n ain’t.”</p>

<p>For a week after that the Tenth indulged
in vain and effeminate luxuries.</p>

<p>Spring brought the fighting and the
tragedy—of the latter, Solomon was the
ink.</p>

<p>They made him color-bearer—he was
so strong, and it was so easy to see him
in his coon-skin cap, his Deckerd strapped
to his back. For he would not lay
it down even while carrying the flag.
At Resaca he took the colors through
balls which came thick enough to stop a
bluebird. Mines cut the tail from his
cap, a buck-and-ball cleared one foot of
bunions, and canister carried his canteen
bodily from his body; but in the
thick of it he yelled out savagely at the
General: “Say, thar, Gen’l, get out o’
thar on that hoss! You mout get ’im
hurt!”</p>

<p>He spent the next week nursing the
wounded enemy: “For ain’t they our
brothers?” he asked, and the scoffers
in blue were silent.</p>

<p>A beautiful valley beyond Resaca and
Solomon had never seen such rich land.
A grand mansion in the valley and Solomon
had never seen such a house. The
General had pitched his camp near by.
A thousand other camps dotted the valleys
and hills. A hundred battle flags
fluttered from their staffs. There was
planning, priming; trenches crept across
the hills in the night, like mole-paths
in a garden, and the valleys were billowed
with them, cannon crowned and
picketed with steel. They would give
little Joe his death blow.</p>

<p>Solomon stood sentinel that night by
the big house on the lawn. It was never
the color-bearer’s duty to stand sentinel—but
“Yer see, Gen’l, Ajax is stalled
right over thar beyant, an’ them brothers
o’ our’n from Kentucky loves a good
hoss.”</p>

<p>It was past midnight and the army was
asleep. There was a light suspiciously
faint in the window of the big house.
Solomon slipped up and peeped in
through a blind slat, awry. He stepped
back blushing, ashamed that he had
peeped. He picked up his Deckerd. The
light went out and the door opened silently
and a handsome man dressed in
citizens’ clothes kissed a Beautiful One
good-bye. Then he slipped out into the
dark and mounted a horse hid so securely
as to surprise Solomon, with his keen
mountain eyes.</p>

<p>“Halt, thar, brother, an’ gin the countersign.”</p>

<p>Pistol shots buzzing from the cylinder
of Colt, and that quick grapple
of horse hoofs in the gravel which
tells of a rowel driven in suddenly; then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the sound of a flying horse through the
lane.</p>

<p>Silence, then quaintly as if talking to
himself: “A cyclone spiked with hell-fire!
Solomon, yer nurver had so narrow
a shave—yer’ll be keerful ther nex’
time yer brother a gatlin’-gun buckled to
a thoroughbred.”</p>

<p>The girl clutched the window—white
and with eyes lit with flashes of the
weird starlight. It seemed a half hour
to Solomon before he heard her give a
rippling, cut-off laugh, and the dawn
sprang to her cheeks as the starlight
went out of her eyes. High up on the
mountain she had seen what Solomon
had not—a splinter of light leap out of
the heart of the mountain beyond the
picket lines. Solomon was still watching
her—so strangely fascinated that he
had not noticed the blood running down
his arm. She closed the window with a
happy laugh, and Solomon felt that it
was now night—all around him.</p>

<p>And so the spell of the big house was
upon Solomon and he begged to stand
guard next day. It was early and he
stood silent before the splendor of the
house, the marble steps, the big, hooded
gables, then—</p>

<p>“God! she’s comin’!”</p>

<p>He turned—no, he was a sentinel—he
could not run. She wore white—fluffy
and airy in the warm June morning.
Above—</p>

<p>“Molasses candy hair,” said Solomon,
licking his mouth, “an’, oh, Lord, Black-Eyed-Susan
eyes!”</p>

<p>He thought again of running. Then of
the wild fawn that once ran to meet him,
off in the mountain woods, so innocent
that it knew not that death dwelt with
man.</p>

<p>He slipped behind a tree. Never before
had he been ashamed of his bare
feet. He peeped out—she was still coming—no,
she had come, and he turned
pale and his knees trembled, for there
she stood smiling as only an angel could,
and holding something out to him:</p>

<p>“I know you must be hungry, and it
is so good of you to guard our house.
Now, please let me serve you your breakfast.”</p>

<p>Off came his coon-skin cap. Her smile,
her eyes made him homesick. He saw
the summer lightning playing at midnight
around the peaks of Tiger Head.
Then tears welled which made him hate
himself—him a soldier of the Tenth—and
he slipped farther around the tree. She
was serious instantly, and her beautiful
eyes had sized him up—gratitude, homesickness,
all—and when she peeped
around the tree again—after awhile, and
he had had time to brace himself, she
laughed a musical, comrady laugh, and—</p>

<p>“Now, please don’t be offended, for I
should love so much to be your friend.”</p>

<p>Again the homesickness. That laugh,
that voice—it was the silver ripple of
Telulah Falls under the white stars of
the mountain. That meant home and
Dinah Mariah. Trembling, dazed and
choking with the swelling that made him
wish to do something—to do something
grand for once in his life, he tried to
speak, but ended in bringing his Deckerd
to present arms. She laughed, saluting
him in turn with a saucy military flash
of her pretty hand.</p>

<p>“Miss—Miss”—</p>

<p>“Nellie,” she said, sympathetically,
helping him out.</p>

<p>“Do they—breed ’em—all like you-uns
down here?”</p>

<p>She laughed and handed him the plate.
Solomon knew the ham, but did not
know what the rolls and the orange
were. His hand touched hers—he fumbled
and dropped the plate: “God, but
I thort I—I teched fire!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” and the hurt look made Solomon
wish to fight something for her
sake—“but I’ll soon be back with more.”
She turned with a pretty gesture.</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t,” he called, “send it by
a nigger. Who can eat with a angel
lookin’?” She laughed so heartily at
this that Solomon was soon himself.
When she brought him another plate he
forgot everything except he had seen
her, that at last into his life something
had come. He wished very much to impress
her—to say something grand, but
everything he tried to say ended in a
brag—so unusual for Solomon:</p>

<p>“I was heah las’ night a-guardin’ you-uns,
an’ I come mighty nigh killin’ a
man.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”—and the fun went out of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
eyes. “I am so grateful to you. Did—did—he
hurt you when he fired?”</p>

<p>All the brag went out of him. Not
for the world would he have her know
that.</p>

<p>“No—but—it was a narrow shave.”</p>

<p>“I am so glad—you see he—was—my
brother.”</p>

<p>“Sho’ nuff?” and Solomon guffawed.
Somehow it relieved him so to know
he was only a brother. “Wal, now, how
strange! But the Gen’l was tellin’ us
’bout a Johnny Scout in here, a tall feller
in citizens’ clothes. Oh, he’s played
the devil with us. He knows our plans
better’n we do. We ’low we s’prise little
Joe at Dug’s Gap, but little Joe s’prises
us. Then we ’low we’ll trap him at
Resaca an’ swing round on his flank. But
he come nigh trappin’ us. We laid for
him mighty keerful at New Hope an’
saunt Howard to turn his flank. He
turned our’n. It’s all that’r scout, and
so the Gen’l sed when he saunt me out
las’ night: “Solomon, shoot anything in
citizens’ clothes that tries to buck our
lines. Kill him fust an’ ax him whur
he’s goin’ after’uds.” So when he steps
out las’ night—that brother er your’n—I
was right thar watchin’, an’ I flung
up my old Deckerd an’ I drawed a bead
on him—it was all so plain, him outlined
in the starlight. But he looked so han’sum
a-settin a hoss so lak Ajax thet I
sed: ”No, I’ll not shoot him—he’s somebody’s
brother. An’ sho’ nuff he was
your’n!”</p>

<p>The girl turned white, then pink. Tears
came to her eyes, the sight of which
made Solomon’s jaws set in stern decision.
He pitied her, thinking of Dinah
Mariah—his sister. He swelled savagely:
“Say, but don’t you cry. I’ll lick arry
man that ’ud hurt yo’ brother!”</p>

<p>“That is so sweet of you,” she said
softly.</p>

<p>“Then I fetched my piece down an’
axed him fur the countersign an’—wal,”
he nodded his head up and down meaningly—“I
got it!” He rolled up his sleeve
and showed the red furrow of another
across his arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry—do—do come in
and let mamma and me dress it.”</p>

<p>Solomon laughed: “Now, don’t bother
’bout it, Miss—yo’ bein’ sorry has already
cured it. I’d have it dressed but
Gen’l ’ud find out an’ say I was a fool fur
not shootin’.”</p>

<p>But she dressed it—she and a stately
White-haired one, bringing the salve and
bandages out to his beat; and when
they had finished and the smarting pain
had ceased, Solomon belonged to them.</p>

<p>Then came the strange change in Solomon.
He did not know what it meant.
Why he put on the uniform, the cavalry
boots and the big spurs. Why he wanted
to strut and swell in the pride of his
six feet three, when the old General
blurted out:</p>

<p>“Solomon, damned if you ain’t real
handsome—what’s come over you?”</p>

<p>“Gen’l—Gen’l, I dunno—but I finds myse’f
struttin’ jes like a wood-cock in
the spring.”</p>

<p>“Oho,” laughed the General, “look out,
Solomon.”</p>

<p>That was all open—seen of all men.
But secretly, silently, painfully—in the
depths of his great soul something stirred
within him that he told to no man, for
he knew not what it was. What it did
he knew: “God, it lifts me out o’ the
clay o’ myse’f!”</p>

<p>Never had he been so happy. Ride?
He could ride Ajax over a whole regiment.
He could lick Johnston’s whole
army. “An’ the cu’is part, Solomon—yer
fool—you are wantin’ to fight outwardly,
but in’ardly you are cryin’ all the time.”</p>

<p>It hurt him when he saw her. He was
sorry when she brought him his meals;
he got behind a tree and wept when she
left, and in this state he stopped one
day and turned white: “God, mebbe it’s
that thar blin’ staggers I’ve got—that I
heur’n so o’ fo’ks havin’ in the rich
valleys.” The dreadful blind staggers he
had heard of all his life—that never
came to those high up in the pure air
of the mountain! He was sure they
had him.</p>

<p>It was the third day and twilight, and
when she came out, bringing his supper,
the red ribbon in the white of her gown,
her dark eyes above, made him think
of the tiger lilies that grew by Telulah.
He pretended not to see her and when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
she blocked his path with a pretty smile
and salute, he feigned astonishment:</p>

<p>“Law, but I thort the moon had riz!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are a poet, Solomon, and a
dreadful flatterer,” but she laughed in
so pleased a way that Solomon swelled
up in his great chest and blew deep and
long, snorting it out, to loosen the great
hurting feeling that was there. Then,
too, he had seen Ajax do it with the thunder
of battle in his nostrils.</p>

<p>She sat on the stump before him, kicking
her slippered heels against the rough
bark and watching him so keenly with
measuring, wistful eyes.</p>

<p>“Solomon, I have been thinking, and
mother and I want you to come in the
house and hear my music. You have
been so good to us and we are so fond
of you.” She jumped down, took his
hand and led him. It burned him—it
made him gasp for breath, yet all he
could do was to follow.</p>

<p>And the house—never before had he
seen splendor. They had trouble persuading
him to step on the rugs and to
walk on the carpets. But the sweet-faced,
white-haired lady came graciously
forward and shook his hand which made
him feel better. Then the Angel sat
down before something Solomon had
never seen and—</p>

<p>They both stood over him ten minutes
afterwards, for he was sitting on a sofa
weeping:</p>

<p>“’Scuse me—no—no, ’taint my wounded
arm—it’s that’r thing over thar that’s
waked up the cat birds in the roderdendrums
at home, an’ I heurd the water
failin’ over Telulah an’ the wind at midnight
in Devil’s Gorge, an’ I nurver
knowed befo’ whut little Dinah Mariah
had missed bein’ a deef-mute an’—so—it
sot me ter bellerin’ this away.”</p>

<p>They were very gentle with him after
that, and more gracious, and when the
Angel played another piece full of dash
and jig and rosened-bow and thunder,
he stood it until the blood began to boil
under his hair and they found him again
in the middle of the floor shouting:</p>

<p>“Hurrah, boys! Lord, but can’t he
run? Come home, Ajax!” “’Scuse me—’scuse
me—Mrs.—Mrs.—Angul—” after
he came to himself—“but—but—she
plays that thing ’zactly like Ajax runs.”</p>

<p>It was the greatest day that had ever
come into his life, and when he left to go
back to his beat he proclaimed exultingly
to the White-haired one that it was
“Christmas, an’ hog-killin’ an’ heav’n all
rolled into one.”</p>

<p>It was twilight when she came out on
the lawn, dressed in white with ribbons
in her hair. When he turned she had
perched herself on her favorite stump
and was beckoning him to sit by her.
Trembling, weak he obeyed, his great
arm touching hers, which thrilled him
so that pains shot into his wounds. She
was silent, looking at him with the same
wistful, doubting eyes of the morning.
He had seen them before, in camp, when
the boys gambled and their month’s pay
was at stake, holding a card aloft uncertain
whether to cast or not. And how
they held him—those eyes of hers with
the tragedy in them!</p>

<p>“Solomon, you know how we love you,
mamma and I.” He sat mute with bowed
head. “And Solomon, if I trust you—if
I tell you—will you never betray?”</p>

<p>“Whut—like that’r Judas I onct heurn
of the time I went to meetin’?” She
nodded. It hurt him. “I can’t betray—It
ain’t in me,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Solomon. I knew it,”
and she put her hand in his just as
Dinah Mariah had so often done, except
that this made his heart beat so it bothered
his breathing and unlike Dinah
Mariah’s he could not—she being an
angel—clasp it in turn. “Now, Solomon,
my brother is coming to-night—he will
slip in yonder,” and she pointed to a
by road leading through shrubbery to a
side gate. “You are not to see him,
Solomon, and you are to let him out the
same way after we have fed him. For
he is hungry, Solomon, and in great danger—been
surrounded and hiding for
days—they are on his trail. Your men,
you know, have killed his horse”—(Solomon
winced—it hurt him to hear of a
horse being killed)—“and, Solomon, this
is the only way he can get out—can save
his life—for—for, Solomon, they are to
take him dead or alive.” She had ceased
to smile. Tears were in her eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Solomon’s great hand closed over her little
one.</p>

<p>“So he’p me God, I’ll nurver pester
him!”</p>

<p>“And when he is ready to go—to try
to escape, oh, Solomon, you will stand
by us—with Ajax ready?”</p>

<p>He started—he jumped from his seat.
“Not Ajax—any critter we got but Ajax.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Solomon, they cannot run—it’s—it’s—Ajax
or death for him.”</p>

<p>She was weeping, her head on his
great shoulder, clinging to his arm, the
perfume of her hair going into the soul
of him like the odor of wild grape blossoms
after the spring rains in Dingley
Dell. “Will you—will you, Solomon; oh,
save him for me!”</p>

<p>“So he’p me God, I will—he bein’ yo’
brother—my brother.”</p>

<p>“You are my brother, Solomon—the
Brother of Nobility.”</p>

<p>Silence. He sat holding her hand as
he would Dinah Mariah’s. “Will you—er—kiss
yo’ brother—when he gits here?”</p>

<p>She blushed. “Don’t we always kiss
our brothers, Solomon?”</p>

<p>He scratched his head thoughtfully.
“Awhile ago you made a remark
cal’k’lated ter sorter sot me to ’sposin’
thet mebbe I mou’t also be yo’ brother—”</p>

<p>There was a ripple from Telulah Falls,
the pressure of lips on his cheek, a whiff
of wild grape blossoms in the Dell, a
rustle of skirts up the path, and Solomon
sat breathing hard in silence.</p>

<p>“Wal, ef lightnin’ ’ud only give us
notice when an’ whur it’s goin’ ter
strike!”</p>

<p>In camp he heard news—strange news.
The whole army would strike next day,
for they had Johnston with his flank
wide open; would bag him if that scout
didn’t get back through the lines—Captain
Coleman, the daring rebel scout.
They had him surrounded now in a
thicket by the creek, the man they would
give a brigade for—he was theirs if the
pickets were careful.</p>

<p>Then it all came over Solomon and
with it a blow that brought the great
strange man to dumbness. “I swore not
to betray her—not to be her Judas—oh,
God, enny body but thet white-livered,
snivelin’—” He heard the flag rustling
in the night air. He walked over, crept
under the folds, pressing it to his hot
cheeks, kissing and fondling it. “Judas!
Judas!—oh, my country’s colors.” He
looked across the night to the hills where
a thousand camp-fires twinkled in unbroken
lines of starry sentinels.</p>

<p>“Ye’ve got so menny to defen’ ye,” he
said to the flag, “so menny twixt you an’
death. An’ she—jes’ me—jes’ me!” He
sang low the song that had taken the
camp.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ve seed him in the camp fires of a hunder’d circlin’ camps,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They have builded him an altar in the evenin’ dews an’ damps—”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He stopped and looks at the living
scene before him—it was all so true.
Then lower still:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He has sounded forth the trumpet thet shall nurver know retreat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He is siftin’ out the souls o’ men—”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He sprang up with a pain in his heart.
“Siftin’ out the Judases, an’, oh God, I’m a
Judas arry way you fix it! Why did you
fling me in this heah pit among the
wolves o’ war—away from my mount’in
home—from little Dinah Mariah?”</p>

<p>When Solomon went back to his beat
he had slipped out Ajax, saddled, and
held him in the clump of orchard trees,
near the sweet window where the faint
light came out, that he knew shone also
over her and her brother. He held his
Deckerd proudly, for was he not all that
stood between her and death? He
swelled with the pride of it and that
queer sullen feeling that came over him
at times—that savage feeling he could
not understand—that made him willing to
kill—kill if—</p>

<p>“They’d better not pester her,” he
growled as he heard the pickets go out
for their night’s duty.</p>

<p>He heard them moving in the room.
Her brother was preparing to go. He
peeped and turned away his head. “Somehow
it riles me to see her brother kiss
her that away.” He tapped on the blind
saying softly: “Ready—ready.”</p>

<p>“O, Solomon,” joyfully in a whisper,
“bless you; bless you!”</p>

<p>“No Judas in mine, Angul.”</p>

<p>He turned, for Ajax had thrust his
head over his keeper’s shoulder and the
man laid his cheek against it and his
lips had parted for the pet words which
he never uttered; for there was a noise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
in the dark behind him and two soldiers
tried to rush by to the door of the
room.</p>

<p>Solomon stopped them with his great
Deckerd at port. “Halt fus’ an’ give the
countersign,” he said, and he heard the
scream of a woman, the hurrying of feet
within.</p>

<p>“Stand back, you fool, we are men of
the Tenth and we’ve got Coleman in
there.”</p>

<p>“Stan’ back yerse’f—he’s her brother—my
brother.”</p>

<p>There was a rush at him, into arms
which made them think of a mountain
bear, for he gathered them to his heart,
and the breath of them went out. In the
glare of the wide open door a girl stood
white-faced with tragedy. A man leaped
to the back of a horse and the swaying,
struggling group were baptized in a
shower of flying gravel. Shots and shouts
behind and the scud of a flying horse
into the night.</p>

<p>“You damned traitor!” Solomon dropped
the two men in the paralysis of the
bayonet thrust that sank into his back.</p>

<p>He quivered to the death stroke and
turned beseechingly to the man: “Shoot
me, quick, brother—in the heart—in the
breast—I’m no traitor, no Judas—she’ll
say I ain’t.” The man cocked his rifle
but the great head with the shock of long
hair had gone down and the girl stood between
them.</p>

<p>“No—no—not Judas—she’ll swear I
ain’t.”</p>

<p>She did not seem to notice them—her
beautiful head was turned side-wise listening

they catch him?”</p>

<p>“Whut—an’ him on Ajax? Ho-ho-oh,”
and the great chest, schooled to the

<p>Then joy, great, radiant joy in her
face, and with the returning glory of it
all—tenderness—tenderness and sorrow

hand on the sweat-damp brow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Phosphates_of_Tennessee">The Phosphates of Tennessee</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">H. D. Ruhm</span></p>

<p class="note">Mr. Ruhm is one of the pioneers in
the phosphate field and his paper on this
subject is the work of an expert.—Ed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The phosphates of Tennessee occur
chiefly, in fact, almost entirely, in
the strata representing the Silurian and
Devonian geological ages, or, more properly,
in the former, and in a transition
period between the two.</p>

<p>The Silurian age was essentially the
age of shell fish, animals with their skeletons
entirely on the outside of their
bodies. The deposits of countless millions
of these shell fish and their remains
form the immense beds of limestone representing
the Silurian age. The composition
of these shell fish was carbonate
of calcium, or “lime,” and hence our
common limestones are calcium carbonate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="700" height="450" alt="Fig. A. Fig. B." />
</div>

<p>The Devonian age was the age of fishes
or vertebrates, and owing to the need of
greater elasticity of their bones and
smaller weight, they are composed of
phosphate of calcium, or “lime.” Far
back in the Silurian age the “Hand that
fashioned all things well” began to change
some of these shell fish to provide for
the future order of things, so that their
outside skeletons, or shells, were composed
of phosphate of lime instead of
carbonate. These two commingling, the
resultant beds of rock became somewhat
phosphatic and formed the “phosphatic
limestones” of the Silurian age. In some
places the phosphate shells were in considerable
proportion, and subsequent erosion,
proper underground drainage and
leaching, dissolved out the carbonate of
lime to greater or less extent and left
the “brown phosphate” of the middle
basin, varying in grade according to the
preponderance of phosphate shells in the
original deposit and the extent of the
subsequent leaching. Meantime the
transition stage between the two ages
had been reached and the resulting deposit
spread over the central basin and
the highland rim in the form of a thin
blanket of varying thickness and quality
of the so-called blue rock, which is blue,
brown, gray and black, according to the
coloring matter present or absent, composed
of a preponderance of microscopic
shell fish with skeleton composed of
phosphate of lime, but mixed with enough
carbonate to make the resulting mass
vary from sixty-five per cent to as high
as eighty per cent calcium phosphate.</p>

<p>The subsequent depression and deposit
of Devonian shales and subcarboniferous
beds and subsequent great pressure hardened
all these into rock, and about the
middle of the subcarboniferous age all
these were elevated above the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
country, and while the rest of the
land was taking its turn in being formed
under the seas, this old central basin
was undergoing the wear and tear of
erosion that finally produced the “Dimple
of the Universe,” surrounded by its chain
of hills and ridges and flatwoods of the
highland rim.</p>

<p>In the central basin where conditions
were favorable the intervening strata
between the blue rock and the phosphatic
limestones that were being converted
into “brown rock” were sometimes partly
and sometimes entirely washed away,
and the blanket of the blue rock, cracked
and broken into plates of the hardest and
most durable parts, settled down on the
brown rock, sometimes resting directly
on it and sometimes with a clay seam
left to represent the former intervening
strata.</p>

<p>A glance at the illustrations will show
the process. Let Figure A represent the
deposit as it originally was before the
erosion and leaching started in.</p>

<p>No. 1 represents the layer of blue
rock in its original position; 2 the layers
of limestone underneath; 3 the layers of
highly phosphatic limestone in suitable
condition for leaching; 4 the hard, insoluble
portions of the limestone, and 5
the soluble portions of the limestone,
nonphosphatic.</p>

<p>In Figure B, No. 5 has dissolved out
and disappeared. In No. 3, the carbonate
has leached out and it has separated into
laminations and falling into the places
left by No. 5, has assumed the jumbled
condition found in the dips between lime
boulders; No. 2 has dissolved down to
the clay seam so generally found, varying
in thickness from one or two inches
to two or three feet, and No. 1 has settled
down conforming to the general bottom
of 3 or top of 4, forming the top rock
generally prevalent in the brown rock
field.</p>

<p>If the analysis of the original phosphatic
limestone was, say, 50 per cent
phosphate of lime, 38 per cent carbonate
and 12 per cent insoluble, and other matters,
and the leaching took out all the
soluble carbonate, the resulting mass
would be 80 per cent phosphate, which
is generally the analysis of the bottom
rock at Mt. Pleasant, or the “export,”
as it is termed. The top rock varies in
analysis from 65 to 80, just as the original
blue rock did.</p>

<p>In the highland rim this process took
place only on the slopes of the narrow
creek valleys and occasionally in projecting
points, instead of over large areas
of country as in the central basin.</p>

<p>In the portion of the highland rim
left intact the blue rock remains in place
as a general thing with its varying quality
and thickness, retaining its original
compact form and density.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, is found the
layer of blue rock resting immediately
on the layer of phosphatic limestone,
and where this is the case numerous
faults and dips occur, showing a similar
structure to the Mt. Pleasant formation
typified.</p>

<p>Again, in the central basin or brown
rock region, the top erosion first disintegrated
and then partially took off the
upper layers of shale or flint, sometimes
entirely, sometimes leaving it from one
to forty feet thick, which accounts for
the varying overburden.</p>

<p>In some places the limestone layers
were entirely soluble or reduced to clay
and some acid condition of soil water dissolved
the upper layers of phosphate and
redeposited it in the boulder and stalagmite
forms of the “white rock” found
in Perry and Decatur counties and near
Godwin, in Maury County, and the “boulder
rock” found everywhere to greater
or less extent but in especially heavy
deposits near Nashville on the McGavock
Place. These latter redeposit varieties
vary in analysis from 50 per cent to
as high as 90 per cent phosphate, and
are uncertain as far as the general variety
goes, though individual deposits varying
in extent from one to twenty or
thirty acres, are found of very uniform
quality.</p>

<p>The first phosphate rock discovered
in Tennessee was the kidney formation
that almost always attends the blue rock
and black shale deposit. The eminent
physician, naturalist, botanist and geologist,
Dr. Gattinger, of Nashville, of revered
and beloved memory, was first to
recognize these as phosphate rock, but
being much more interested in determining
the family and pedigree of some new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
beetle or plant than in the commercial
aspect of any mineral proposition, he
never gave his discovery to the world,
and only by his casual mention of the
fact one day to Will Shirley and Maj. W.
J. Whitthorne, of Columbia, are we able
to give him credit for the knowledge.
Dr. Safford, in his “Geology of Tennessee,”
describes in detail both the blue
and brown rocks geologically, referring
to the blue rock as a blue fossiliferous
limestone nearly always occurring under
the Devonian shale; but no chemical investigations
being provided for, he did
not find out that it was a phosphate
rock. Major Whitthorne and Mr. Shirley
kept up a systematic hunt for a deposit
of commercial value and finally the former
located one on upper Swan Creek
simultaneously with the discovery made
lower down the same creek by Messrs.
Bates and Childs. These latter gentlemen
were insistent that the black shale,
commonly called slate rock, so abundant
in the highland rim country, was a form
of, or indicative of the proximity of, coal,
and at regularly recurring intervals they
would send in particularly promising
looking samples to Professor Wharton,
of Nashville, for analysis. One day they
dropped into their bag of samples a piece
of blue rock which they informed Professor
Wharton was nearly always present
under the “slate,” and seemed to
be a “bloom.” What was their astonishment
to receive from Professor Wharton
the report that their coal was still worthless,
but that their bloom was phosphate
rock, analyzing over 70 per cent. This
was in December, 1893, and like the news
of William Tell in Switzerland, of old,
“From hill to hill the summons flew,”
and the whole country went phosphate
and option mad.</p>

<p>Lack of transportation and timidity of
capital, coupled with the large amount
of territory occupied by the deposit and
the numerous parties holding properties
caused the development to be spasmodic
and comparatively small and scattered,
and in consequence the price soon fell
from $4.25 per ton f. o. b. Aetna, which
was the first sale, made by the old Southwestern
Phosphate Co., to $2.25 per ton,
which was the price at which blue rock
guaranteed 65 per cent was sold in 1896,
being just a small margin over the cost
of production and hauling to the railroad.</p>

<p>In January, 1896, at a time when negotiations
were on foot for the sale of a
large tract of blue rock land on Swan
Creek, Mr. S. Q. Weatherly, former
county judge, and prior to that county
surveyor of Lewis County, while on a
trip to Mt. Pleasant, noticed the peculiar
brown rock in the ditch at the roadside
on the W. S. Jennings’ farm west of Mt.
Pleasant, and being interested in minerals,
picked up a piece of it. Noticing the
analagous appearance to the weathered
blue rock, which is generally brown on
the surface, he dropped it in his buggy.
On his return to Swan Creek, he showed
it to Mr. Harry Arnold and Col. D. B.
Cooper, who were interested in the negotiations
above mentioned. These gentlemen
had it analyzed and finding it
to be 75 per cent phosphate rock, induced
Mr. Weatherly to say nothing about it
until after their deal was consummated.
Associated with these gentlemen was
also Mr. W. J. Webster, and during the
time from January to July, 1896, when
the negotiations for the sale of the blue
rock properties were finally closed, they
ascertained partially the extent of the
Mt. Pleasant brown rock field.</p>

<p>When their “big trade” was made they
formed the firm of H. I. Arnold &amp; Co.,
bought two and one-half acres of land
from Mr. Mumford Smith, ostensibly for
a calf lot for Mt. Pleasant’s present genial
mayor, Mr. W. D. Cooper, leased at
a royalty of ten cents per ton a few
acres from Mr. Cooper and a few from a
darky named Tom Smith, got an option
from Mrs. M. G. Frierson on the present
Columbian &amp; Blue Grass Hills, and commenced
mining rock and putting it on the
cars at a cost of about eighty-five cents
per ton. This rock, without preparation,
ran 75 per cent instead of 65 per cent,
but whereas the blue rock had never
run higher than 3 per cent I. &amp; A., this
rock ran, in the state they shipped it,
from 4½ to 6 per cent I. &amp; A.</p>

<p>Of course the manufacturers had
bought blue rock for $2.25, and knew
they were getting it at very nearly the
cost of production, and when they saw
the “snap” the miner had, they took the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
stick this excess of I. &amp; A. gave them
and proceeded to beat the price down
with it until $1.25 and eventually $1.00
per ton were common prices.</p>

<p>Capitalists were rendered more timid
than ever before, and even astute phosphate
man that he was Col. D. B. Cooper
threw up both hands and quit. He said,
“Boys, if that is phosphate, the whole
basin of Middle Tennessee is full of it,
and it will never be worth mining, as every
farmer will pick it up off the ground
and haul it to the railroad.”</p>

<p>Mr. John S. O’Neal, in a paper presented
to the Engineering Association of
the South, as late as 1897, said, “the
owner of a bed of phosphate rock, is
not as well off as the owner of a sand
bank, given the same proximity to
market.”</p>

<p>The poor fellows in the phosphate business,
however, couldn’t get out, and kept
digging away, until gradually capital
decided it was worth buying the lands
after all, and as a result nearly $2,000,000
has been paid for property in the Mt.
Pleasant field, about $500,000 in other
portions of Maury County, and over
$1,000,000 for property in the counties
of Decatur, Perry, Lewis, Hickman, Giles,
Williamson, Davidson and Sumner. Rock
has gradually advanced in price until
now 65 per cent blue rock sells at from
$2.60 to $2.80 per ton, 75 per cent brown
rock at from $3.10 to $3.60 per ton and
78 per cent domestic (4½ I. &amp; A.) at
$3.75 to $4.00, while 78 per cent export
rock with 3 to 4 per cent I. &amp; A. sells
for from $4.00 to $4.25 per ton.</p>

<p>As the prices have increased the cost
of production has increased for one reason
and another, until now each ton of
phosphate rock put on board the cars
represents an average cost in labor and
salaries of $2.00 per ton. The production
for 1904 having been 540,000 tons, the
wage earners of Tennessee have profited
by this industry to the extent of $1,080,000
during last year alone. On the other
hand, fertilizer factories have sprung up
all through the interior of the country
like magic, and as they now get 75 per
cent rock at their factory for less than
the freight they used to pay on 62 per
cent rock from South Carolina, acid phosphate
is cheaper than ever before, and
consequently the farmer gets cheaper
fertilizer or else better fertilizer for the
same money.</p>

<p>The first thing which impresses itself
on the mind of almost any visitor to the
phosphate fields is the almost universal
dependence on hand labor of the simplest
pick and shovel kind. This is partially
due to the fact that they “just started
that way,” and hence the most “experienced
laborers” have always done that
way; and partially to the fact that after
sufficient capital was at hand for the
purpose, the varying conditions met with
in the deposit made it very difficult to
devise appliances suitable for one portion
of a mine that would answer the
requirements in the closely adjacent
portions.</p>

<p>For instance, it is possible in the same
open face of a mine to find the overburden
varying from two feet to twenty
and the rock from a few inches thick,
sticking tight to the top of a lime boulder,
to fifteen feet in the “dip between two
boulders,” while the rock itself will vary
from the shaly, partially disintegrated
top rock through various sizes to heavy
blocks six to eight inches thick and often
ten or twelve feet long.</p>

<p>It will therefore be seen how difficult
it is to design a machine that will accommodate
itself to the handling of this
material. The removal of the overburden
has been generally accomplished
with wheel scrapers. Two companies
have used the New Era or Western machine
plow with elevator belt loading the
dirt into dump bottom wagons alongside.
Two steam shovels are now in use, being
of the traction type, and occasionally
these have been used in digging the rock,
though apparently with not sufficient
success to justify its continuance. Cableways
have never been used to transport
the material and this is done largely by
wagon and team, though many tram
roads with cars propelled either by mules
or dinky engines are in use.</p>

<p>The bulk of the rock, however, is dug
by the miner with pick and fork, loaded
into wagons, hauled out and dumped in
windrows on the ground, stirred with a
potato plow and harrows, allowed to dry
in the sun, taken up again into wagons
and hauled either direct to cars for shipping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
or put under sheds for storage.
When an extra good quality of rock
is wanted, as for export, a few layers of
cordwood are put down and the sun-dried
rock put on that. Then, when
ready to ship, the wood is fired, and after
the rock is cool, it is broken and loaded
with forks, when most of the dirt sloughs
off, leaving the rock almost perfectly
clean.</p>

<p>Some rock can be put from the mines
immediately on the wood and burned for
export, but generally this will only be a
safe domestic rock. Some companies
who have water accessible, pick out the
large pieces and send them direct to the
dry kilns and then the small pieces with
the dirt, known as “muck,” are passed
through washers, the rock coming out
clean, and being deposited on cordwood
and burned as above described.</p>

<p>The resulting rock, after being crushed,
is passed through screens which separate
it in three sizes, from one and one-half
inch up going for export, between
that and one-fourth inch for domestic,
and the dust and one-fourth inch pieces
being ground up and sold for direct use
or to small factories.</p>

<p>The Century Phosphate Co. has installed
a system of dryers and do not
wash the rock, but dry it thoroughly in
mechanical dryers and then screen and
separate it as above.</p>

<p>The reason the larger pieces are as
a rule of higher grade than the smaller,
is that the dirt and impurity is mostly
on the surface of the rock and the
greater the proportion of surface to volume
the lower the grade in B. P. L.
and the higher in iron and alumina.</p>

<p>Owners and operators of mines are
gradually turning their attention to labor-saving
devices for primary operations,
and for systems of reclaiming the immense
amount of waste that has heretofore
gone on, both in the mining and the
preparation of the rock.</p>

<p>One marked step forward in the business
is the establishment of a small
mixing plant for making complete fertilizers,
and the commencing of operations
on a large acid phosphate factory,
with prospects for additional ones
later on.</p>

<p>At least ten per cent of the present
output is thrown away to prepare the
high grade rock necessary, and this
waste will make good 13 per cent acid
phosphate, so that every year 50,000
tons of valuable material is absolutely
thrown away. This is more phosphate
rock than is annually used by any one
fertilizer factory in the world, so far
as known to the writer. This waste
product could easily be transported to
a local factory for an average cost of
less than 50 cents per ton. Sulphuric
acid can be bought laid down at Mt.
Pleasant for $7 per ton. The mixing
and other preparation will not exceed
$2 per ton, so that using half acid and
half rock the cost of the acid phosphate
will not be more than $4.75 per ton,
while it will probably sell for at least
$8 per ton. From these figures we
appear to be throwing into the waste pile
at present material that should represent
a profit of not less than $162,500 per
annum. That this will be allowed to
continue does not appear likely. The
question might arise, however, “What
will you do with the acid phosphate thus
manufactured to keep from overcrowding
or at least injuring the market?”
I should answer this by calling attention
to the immense area of land in Maury,
Lawrence, Lewis and Hickman counties,
known as “The Barrens,” which are gradually
being denuded of their timber for
cordwood that is shipped to Mt. Pleasant
for use in drying the phosphate rock.
There are at least 250,000 acres of this
land, which is now readily purchasable
at $3 per acre, with the cord wood on it.
The wood alone will yield in value more
than this price, thus leaving the land
clear. Now, it has been demonstrated
at Lawrenceburg, Summertown, Loretto,
St. Joseph, Hohenwald and numerous
other places that systematic and intelligent
farming, even with the meager supply
of fertilizer (almost entirely in the
shape of bone meal) that has been used,
will bring these lands up to a point where
they will bring from fifteen to twenty
bushels of wheat or from twenty-five to
thirty bushels of corn per acre. Such
lands that have been so brought up
readily sell for from $10 to $40 per acre,
according to location.</p>

<p>From experiments it has been ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
that the principal element of plant
food lacking in these soils is phosphoric
acid. The application of 275 pounds of
acid phosphate per acre each year on
these lands would consume right at our
doors the entire output of the proposed
acid factory, even if none were sold
elsewhere. This appears chimerical to
the casual observer, I must confess, but
a careful investigation will demonstrate
the soundness of the position taken.</p>

<p>With more or less frequency, according
to whether the news supply is sufficiently
good to enable them to get “their per
column,” correspondents fire into the
several papers of the State some sensational
head-liny article about the new
“discovery of phosphate rock at Crossroadsville,
5 to 40 feet thick, analyzing
from 60 to 90 per cent bone phosphate of
lime.” For fear of being behindhand
with the news all the papers copy it,
and before the report can be corrected
to its proper reality of from 6 to 9 per
cent, it has been heralded to the four
corners of the earth and its effect on
future and pending sales can better be
imagined than estimated.</p>

<p>If one will take the reports of the geological
survey he will find that every
possible deposit of phosphate rock in
the State is absolutely and positively
located. There will be no new discoveries.
Of course there will be much new
development, but the location of such
development will have been discovered
long before.</p>

<p>The principal localities in the State
where operations are now in progress,
are: Mt. Pleasant, Kleburn, Jameson and
Century, in Maury County; Lower Swan
Creek, Twomey and Totty’s Bend, in Hickman
County; near Gallatin, in Sumner
County; Wales Station, in Giles County,
and near Nashville, in Davidson County.</p>

<p>The principal localities where developments
will gradually take place as the
demands of the business require are:
Southport, Estes Bend, Bear Creek,
Neeley’s Valley, Little Bigby, West Fork,
<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">*</a>Baptist Branch and <a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">*</a>Leiper’s Creek, in
Maury County; Richland Creek, in Giles

<p>Anything exploited outside of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
known and designated deposits is very
apt to prove either a flash in the pan
or will be found to be only worked by
the newspaper correspondents at so much
per column.</p>

<p>Of the present working localities the
principal one is Mt. Pleasant, and while
the property owners there are beginning
to figure a little on how much they have
left, still the prevailing impression
that Mt. Pleasant is about through mining
is an exceedingly mistaken one. With
the present rate of output, the visible
supply of the Mt. Pleasant field proper
will last for seven years longer, without
taking into consideration the Southport
field, which is practically part of the
Mt. Pleasant field. With the Southport
field mining will last here at the present
rate of output for eleven years. It is
very easy to understand that as work
progresses at Mt. Pleasant and the end
comes more nearly in sight, some miners
drop out by selling, some by working
out their small deposits and these naturally
go to the other fields above referred
to. In none of the other fields
is found the persistently uniform high
grade brown rock of Mt. Pleasant except
Southport, Century and Kleburn, in the
two latter of which operations are now
in progress, and in the former the extension
of the Mt. Pleasant Southern Railway
will soon cause development work
there.</p>

<p>As these deposits afford practically the
same grade of rock as Mt. Pleasant
proper, they will be worked out simultaneously
with it and will cater to the
same market.</p>

<p>With their knowledge that the visible
supply of this character of rock
is comparatively limited, producers are
gradually increasing their prices, and by
reason of such increase they are slowly
reducing their output and giving opportunity
for the marketing of the lower
grades in the other fields, notably the
Swan Creek and Indian Creek deposits
in Hickman County.</p>

<p>This, of course, means that the producers
at Mt. Pleasant will make more
money from their product, and that it
will last a considerably longer time, so
that it is safe to say that mining in
force will be carried on at Mt. Pleasant
and kindred localities for at least twenty
years.</p>

<p>During the next decade, to supply the
diminution of Mt. Pleasant’s output, will
come the gradual development of the
vast blue rock field of Maury, Hickman
and Lewis counties, and the white rock
of Perry and Decatur counties, which
form the backbone of the phosphate industry
in Tennessee, and whose millions
of tons will cause these counties to be
considered the phosphate reservoir of
the world for the next seventy-five or
one hundred years.</p>

<p>The change of base will be gradual
and easy, and the trade will have ample
opportunity and time to adjust its operations
so as to utilize the lower grade
blue rock as it becomes advisable and
necessary to do so. Its many points
of superiority for acidulation and for
direct use without acidulation will largely
make up for its lower grade, and as a
mining proposition it more nearly approaches
a technical field of operation.</p>

<p>The blue rock field proper covers a
territory bounded approximately by a
trapezoid having as its four corners
Centreville, in Hickman County; Kinderhook
and Mt. Joy, in Maury County,
and Lewis Monument, in Lewis County.
Traversing this territory are Duck River,
Indian, Swan, Blue Buck and Cathey’s
creeks, and their tributaries, and outcropping
along these valleys and underlying
the ridges between them are deposits
of blue rock running in bone phosphate
from 60 per cent to 78 per cent,
with less than 3 per cent iron and alumina,
that will aggregate in the neighborhood
of 40,000,000 tons.</p>

<p>This field will soon be developed by
the extension of the Nashville, Chattanooga
&amp; St. Louis branch up Swan Creek
and the Louisville &amp; Nashville branch
down Swan Creek, with side lines and
spurs leading off each, surveys for which
have been made, and work on construction
will soon be under way.</p>

<p>If, however, the Florence Northern
Railroad should ever be built from Florence
to Nashville it will run through the
heart of this territory as well as the
magnificent iron deposits of Wayne and
Lewis.</p>

<p>With the above road and a road from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
Huntsville on the southeast to Milan on
the northwest all of the phosphate territory
would be fully developed, and this
section of Maury, Hickman, Lewis, Perry,
Giles, Davidson and Williamson counties
would be the site of more fertilizer factories
than will be found elsewhere in
the world in the same space.</p>

<p>Contributary to such prospective development
is the present opening up of
pyrites deposits at Pyriton, near Talladega,
Ala., with ore running two to four
units higher than the Virginia ores, and
while from four to six units lower than
the best Spanish ores, it is much more
free burning than the latter, and with its
advantage in freight rates, will likely
give manufacturers equally as good a
product at a lower price.</p>

<p>The vein of pyrites is about one and
one-half miles long and from four to
fifteen feet thick and has been exploited
to a depth of 430 feet, the ore improving
in quality with the depth. It is reported
by manufacturers who have used it to
be the freest burning pyrites ore known,
leaving only about ½ of 1 per cent of the
sulphur in the cinder and containing no
deleterious ingredients. The deposits are
controlled by the Alabama Pyrites Company
and the Southern Sulphur Ore Company,
the latter owned by Messrs. Carpenter
&amp; Howard, of Columbia, their
vein running from eight to fifteen feet
thick. The railroad into this deposit has
been built from the Louisville &amp; Nashville,
at Talladega, a distance of twenty
miles, at a cost of nearly $400,000.</p>

<p>The consumption of fertilizers has increased
200 per cent in the United States
in the past twelve years, and while the
visible supply of phosphate rock is rapidly
decreasing, the consumption of fertilizers
is almost as rapidly increasing, and
with this fact in view, the large fertilizer
companies are and have been for several
years gradually buying up phosphate
lands to provide themselves for the future.
This tendency has put a large
amount of phosphate property in such
strong hands that little or no danger
is possible of the old scramble to sell,
with its attendant low prices. At the
same time, a considerable amount of
land valuable for its phosphate deposits
is still uncontrolled by manufacturers, so
that a healthy competition in the business
is still open.</p>

<p>The amount of fertilizer used in Middle
Tennessee is almost a minus quantity,
but this state of things cannot long exist.
The horse worked continuously without
feeding soon dies, and so it will be, nay
already is, with much of our land in the
“dimple of the universe.”</p>

<p>Farmers know that the crops of ten
years ago cannot be raised to-day and
are all waking up to the fact that something
is needed. The large stock-raiser,
who husbands his stable manure, can
partially take care of the thin spots on
his land. But the small farmer, the backbone
of the country, whose acres do not
afford him land sufficient to till and still
have the rich pastures necessary to raise
much stock, contents himself with simply
wearing out his farm, selling it at a low
price, generally with the mediation of
the sheriff, and moving elsewhere for
better or more probably for worse. To
this class the use of fertilizer in Tennessee
is practically unknown, but their successors
of the next few decades will
form, as is the case in other States,
the bulk of the fertilizer consumers,
and when this comes to pass Tennessee
will indeed have come into her own.</p>

<p>The use of fertilizer in the cotton
States has enabled the planters to continue
year after year to raise the enormous
crops of cotton and has also enabled
them to diversify their crops by
being able to produce the same yield of
cotton on a less number of acres.</p>

<p>So fertilizers will enable the Middle
Tennessee farmers to raise the same
amount of feed on fewer acres, leaving
more land to grow up to blue grass,
and our present greatly depreciated live
stock interests will come up by leaps
and bounds until we will rival the famous
blue grass section of Kentucky, if we
do not far outstrip it.</p>

<p>When one stops to consider (1) that
the wheat crop alone annually removes
from the soil of the United States more
phosphoric acid than is the equivalent
of twice the amount of phosphate rock
produced in the country; and (2) that
over half of the amount mined is exported
so that the fertilizers used in
the United States return to the soil only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
one-fourth of the phosphoric acid that is
taken away by the wheat crop alone,
without considering the other crops, we
can readily see that the consumption of
fertilizer and phosphate rock not only
will, but of right ought to, enormously
increase, and that the industry is a permanent
one that will last without cessation
or danger of serious interruption as
long as the world eats bread. That it
has been and still is being developed
almost entirely by outside capital is one
of the features that seems to attend
the development of practically all the industries
of the State.</p>

<p>The rock which is exported from Tennessee
goes to England, Scotland, Ireland,
Belgium, Holland, France, Spain,
Italy, Austria and Japan. The domestic
rock is consumed by the various fertilizer
factories all over that part of the United
States east of the Mississippi River, some
of the principal points being Philadelphia,
Pa.; Buffalo, N. Y.; Cleveland and
Columbus, Ohio; Chicago, Ill.; Indianapolis,
Ind.; Lynchburg, Staunton, Norfolk
and Richmond, Va.; Memphis, Nashville
and Chattanooga, Tenn.; Greenville, Columbia
and Charleston, S.&nbsp;C.; Charlotte
and Winston, N.&nbsp;C.; Macon and Atlanta,
Ga.; Meridian, Miss.; Birmingham, Montgomery
and Mobile, Ala.</p>

<p>In conclusion, a word might be appropriate
on the subject of the direct use of
raw ground phosphate rock as a fertilizer,
without acidulation.</p>

<p>The experiment stations of the great
States of Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Maryland and New Jersey have made
exhaustive experiments with this material,
and their bulletins may be had by
any farmer desiring them, showing that
this material has given results that prove
it to be more valuable for many soils
than the acidulated phosphate. The great
State of Tennessee, on the other hand,
without any practical experiments to
back it up, in the face of the opinions
of some of its most eminent chemists
and experts, continues on its statute
book an absolute prohibition against the
sale of this material within its borders.</p>

<p>Mr. Cyril Hopkins, of the Illinois Experiment
Station, says that the discovery
of the Tennessee phosphate deposits is
the greatest thing that ever happened
for the farmers of Illinois.</p>

<p>Each year many carloads of this material
are shipped into other States and
wherever it has been used its use is
spreading, yet these people have to pay
more in freight alone than it would cost
the average Tennessee farmer at his
farm.</p>

<p>Immense deposits of this rock exist
in Tennessee high enough in grade to
meet the requirements for direct use,
and if this prohibition were removed,
almost every county seat in the sixth
and seventh congressional districts would
have phosphate mills to supply the local
trade, just as they have flour mills.</p>

<p>The next Legislature should certainly
correct the errors of the past by allowing
the Tennessee farmer to exercise the
same amount of free agency, common
sense judgment as his fellows of the
other States.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The achievements and development of
the pacer in the past ten or fifteen
years, since the advent of the Hals, and
the swift tribe of trotting-bred pacers,
has been so marked and so great that
a special chapter is needed for its explanation.
The old “side-wheeler” has
gone—the new, beautifully gaited, true
striding pacing race horse has taken his
place. No other feature of a race meeting
brings out the crowd and the enthusiasm
equal to the free-for-all pace.
Never before had such races been witnessed
as those first seen in the days
of the Big Four—the queen of which was
Mattie Hunter 2:12½, the first great
Hal mare to attract the attention of the
world. She was the star of the Big
Four, the others being Blind Tom, Lucy
and Rowdy Boy. Later, some of the
great free-for-allers were Little Brown
Jug, Brown Hal, Hal Pointer, Robert J,
Direct, Joe Patchen, John R Gentry and
many others whose names will be readily
remembered by every horseman. The
very mention of these names brings a
thrill to the heart as, toward the last
of the century, Robert J, John R. Gentry
and Joe Patchen and Star Pointer began
to bring the pacing record to
the two-minute mark. This was first
done by Star Pointer, an inbred
Hal, crossed again and again in the
thoroughbred blood which, undoubtedly,
gave to the Hals the staying power so
characteristic of the family. And so,
looking back, the following article, written
by Trotwood December 29, 1892,
seems prophetic—that is, if there were
such a thing as prophecy. But, alas,
there is not, for prophecy is merely another
name for the cause of the future
as foreseen in the present’s effect. And
though this was written thirteen years
ago, it is embodied into this history, as
fitting so well the present:</p>

<p>“There can no longer be any doubt
that the pacer, as a future product on
the light harness race course, will be a
still stronger factor than he is to-day.
Even if desired, it is now not possible
to eliminate him from the light harness
breeding world. He has come to stay.
It matters not to us whether the honest,
but sturdy, rascal can trace his ancestors
to Marsh’s five-toed orohippos, weighing
about forty pounds, and which had all
he could do to keep out of the way of
Darwin’s “missing link,” and thus save
himself from drudgery, even before the
days of the Silurian serpents, or whether
he was developed in Trojan wars as
carved on the frieze of Grecian temples;
the fact remains the same, that to-day
he is here by a large majority, and
though snubbed by his more aristocratic
brother, he persistently refuses to stay
behind in the procession, and is never
happier than when he can get up a good,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
rattling fight in a five-heat race, or stick
his common, but inquisitive, nose a few
seconds beyond the trotting record securely
placarded on the front of old
Father Time. Flung into the world
without prestige, friends or influence; his
coming regarded as the epitome of a
breeder’s ill luck; condemned before he
was born, and damned before he could
walk; a little too good to kill, yet
hardly good enough to be allowed
a square meal once a week that
he might grow up like any other horse;
toe-weighted and hobbled and banged
about, and forced to trot in spite of
the laws of nature herself, yet the game
and honest little fellow, when relieved
of his owner’s prejudices and hobbles,
has flown to the front with the ease of
a swallow through the air and the grace
of a game fish in the lake, and now
holds the first record for speed and the
chief place on the program in the eye
of a grand stand that paid its way to
see an honest horse race.</p>

<p>“It is the old story of the rejected
stone, and he now holds up with surprising
popularity his corner of the race
horse structure. And yet twenty years
ago a pacer was scarcely allowed on a
fashionable race course; his pedigree,
they said, took to the woods on the first
cross; he was regarded by the trotting
world as a camel-backed, cat-hammed,
narrow-chested, curby-legged beast who
paced because he couldn’t trot, and was
alive because nobody cared to buy powder
enough to kill all of them in the
woods of Tennessee and Kentucky. He
was allowed to exist on the race course
very much on the same idea that a slave
is allowed to breathe the same air and
view the same heaven his master does.
He began his career because he was a
good kind of an animal to have around
to do the race act at the pumpkin show
and come in along with the fat woman
and the five-legged calf. His coming to
the front was his own work; and to
use a classical phrase, he was purely
the architect of his own fortune. The
American people are a long time finding
out merit, but nothing helps them to see
it as quickly as the image of the American
eagle stamped on the back of a silver
dollar—and this the pacer has shown
them.</p>

<p>“Despite the oft-repeated theory of ‘the
Canadian pacer,’ there is no doubt that
the pacer as now found in Kentucky,
Tennessee and the West came originally
from the older Atlantic States, such as
Virginia and the Carolinas, and that he
was brought there by our forefathers
from England. The fact that there are
pacers in Canada merely proves that in
that Dominion also they have been
brought from the mother country. To
trace their origin in England is both a
tedious task and a most uncertain one.
Yet, from the best information obtainable,
there appears to be but little doubt
that the pacer was originally a product
of Spain, where many years ago he was
bred in the purple as a pleasure animal
for the nobility of Andalusia and other
Spanish states. In fact, it is more than
probable that he was bred with more
care than was bestowed by the Spanish
upon their now favorite animal—the ass.
We know that the pacer was safely domiciled
in England as far back as the Norman
Conquest, for in ‘Ivanhoe,’ written
by that most painstaking scholar and
novelist, Sir Walter Scott—a man who
wrote truer to nature and with as much
historic accuracy as any novelist who
has ever lived in England—we find many
allusions to the pacer under the style
of the palfrey and the ambler.</p>

<p>“The following is an extract from Ivanhoe,
Chapter II., the scene being in the
time of Richard I. In reading it we
must remember that the name jennet did
not mean then as now the female of
an ass, but it meant the palfrey which
the lay brother was riding. Says Sir
Walter: ‘This worthy churchman rode
upon a well-fed, ambling mule, whose
furniture was highly decorated and whose
bridle, according to the fashion of the
day, was ornamented with silver bells....
A lay brother, one of those who
followed in the train, had for his use
on other occasions one of the most handsome
Spanish jennets ever bred in Andalusia,
which merchants used at that
time to import, with great trouble and
risk, for the use of persons of wealth
and distinction. The saddle and housings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
of this superb palfrey were covered
by a long boat cloth which reached
nearly to the ground, and on which were
richly embroidered mitres, crosses and
other ecclesiastical emblems.’</p>

<p>“From other writings of Sir Walter
Scott we find that the knight usually,
when not in battle, rode upon an ambler,
and a page, riding also upon the same
kind of a horse, led the knight’s large
war horse, with his armorial trappings.
The fact that in the above extract the
mule also paced, goes to show how
strong must have been the pacing instinct
in his dam, being able to overcome
entirely the gait of the ass. But
to go further into the history of the pacer
in England would be foreign to the ends
of this brief article.</p>

<p>“We will only add that in spite of the
fact that many English breeders assert
that not a pacer has been kept in that
country for many years, yet we believe
that this is not true and that there
are many of them there to-day. But
to return to our own pacer. It is quite
easy to trace his career as he came from
the mother colonies, spreading out
through Kentucky, Tennessee and the
States of the Northwest, under the name
of the ‘saddle horse,’ by which name he
was held in the highest esteem and filled
an humble but most important position
in the pioneer work of State making.
Before the roads were cut out through
the forests, and when only blazed Indian
paths were the highways of the country,
he was an absolute necessity, and to-day
there belongs to him the proud honor
of having been the first common carrier
of American civilization. He was with
Marion and Sumter in their partisan
warfare in the Carolinas; he saw, no
doubt, with patriotic emotion, the ignoble
surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown;
he followed the intrepid Boone across
the Alleghanies into Kentucky, and came
along with the immortal Jackson—the
man of destiny—into the ‘basin of middle
Tennessee.’ Pulling the plow for an
honest living in the rich cornfields during
the week, he carried the women and
the children on his back to the primitive
church on Sunday. As civilization advanced
he improved with it, being crossed
with thoroughbred blood in rich profusion,
until to-day his lines of breeding
are thoroughly established, and by his
speed, gameness and bottom he has advanced
from the humble position of the
family man-of-all-work to the fleet-footed
king of the light-harness world—from
the simple cabin in the clearing, and the
gentle caress of the backwoodman’s family,
to the applause of the grand stand.</p>

<p>“A scrub, indeed! He was here fighting
for independence and an honest living
when the forefathers of the Wilkes and
Almonts—since old imp. Messenger is
regarded as the fountain head—were
courting the favor of royalty in England
‘that thrift may follow fawning,’ or carrying
soup-drinking Britons on their jolting
backs to the wharves of Liverpool,
to be shipped over here as food for Tennessee
rifles at New Orleans. Plebian,
did you say? Why, he ought to be pensioned.
He is older and more respectable
than the Dutch governors of New York
and has a greater claim to patriotism
than half of the pensioners who never
smelled the smoke of battle.</p>

<p>“In Tennessee and Kentucky he has
always been a great favorite, and since
the race-track act has been added to his
many other accomplishments he is destined
to be yet more popular. But the
student who attempts to trace his development
is lost in a maze of thoroughbred
blood and ‘native stock.’ That
the ‘pacing-bred pacer’ of to-day is simply
a mixture of the old ambling pacer of
Europe, whatever he was, and thoroughbred
there is no doubt in the world.
And that this thorough blood has been
as good, if not better, than that in old
Messenger himself, is also true. But the
astonishing thing about this amalgamation
is the very small per cent of pacing
blood it required to leaven the thoroughbred
loaf. A pacing sire bred to a running
mare and that offspring to another
running mare, and so on for several
generations, will end with the last, as
with the first, in getting a ‘saddler.’</p>

<p>“We have always regarded this fact
as the strongest evidence of the intensity
of the pacing instinct—an instinct that
has such a pure and strong fountain-head
somewhere that it is able to overcome
the running instinct, though crossed and
recrossed upon the pure running blood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
is abundant evidence of its own purity
and prepotency. And the fact that so
many fast pacers are continually thrown
from the trotting ranks, now commonly
called ‘trotting-bred pacers,’ is but another
illustration of the same fact. Verily,
back somewhere in the past the pacer
was a thoroughbred at his way of going.
His remote ancestor, whether in the
myths of fables, or in the woods of
northern Germany, or the vine-clad hills
of Spain, or around the frozen lakes
of Canada, was an Alexander, a Julius
Caesar and a Napoleon Bonaparte, all
in one, in the greatness and gameness of
his gait. How else could the fact that
every great family of trotters is continually
throwing pacers be explained by
any other theory? The fact that the
trotting breeders have been careless in
breeding to mares of strong pacing instinct
or breeding, we admit; but the
fact remains the same that the pacing
blood in the pedigree of such trotters
does not appear to have acted as a brake
in their way of going, but, on the contrary,
has given to them a smoothness
of action and an elasticity of stride which
has carried them to the foremost rank
at their gait; and we are also led to
believe that it often requires but a small
portion of pacing fluid to overcome several
generations of the diagonal gait
in the veins of the trotting-bred horse.</p>

<p>“Take from the trotting ranks those
out of mares or descendants of mares by
old Pilot, Jr., and other pacers, and the
truth of this assertion will be most plainly
seen. In fact, every noted family of
trotters, such as the Wilkses and the
Almonts—wherever there is any pacing
blood, even away back in the fourth and
fifth generation—have to the credit of
that family some pacer who is faster
at his way of going than the star trotter
of that family is at his. No Hambletonian
trotter has ever attained the speed
that has been shown by Direct, unless it
be Nancy Hanks, who has some pacing
blood in her own royal veins and is
inclined to pace a bit herself; nor has
any Almont trotter ever equalled Flying
Jib and hosts of others we might mention.
Among the Wilkses they are
thicker than the leaves of Valambrosa,
until one is forced to believe that the
Clay blood, if such it was, in the pedigree
of George Wilkes was about as
good as any the great horse had in his
veins.</p>

<p>“These facts being true, it is evident
that the pacer is not a scrub. If he is
a scrub, then we are forced to the conclusion
that nothing in all the breeding
world may be likened to the intensity
of his cold-bloodedness. This scrub
blood overcomes the hot running blood,
though continually diluted for successive
generations; and it needs only a little
of it to knock out the hopes of the bluest
blooded trotter descended from Hambletonian
lines. If he is a scrub, then he
is the veritable ‘original sire’ of the
scrub horse business, which, like that in
man, is ever on top. But as this sin
of the pacer helps him to the wire first,
and has given him the harness records
of the world, we trust no trotting moralist
will attempt to entirely obliterate it.
We don’t need any crucifixions there!
To our mind, we believe that if the curtain
of the past could ever be unrolled
upon the pacers of old we would find that
centuries ago he was bred for no other
way of going, and bred so long and so
purely and so consistently that in him
has been planted an instinct that will
never be obliterated. To argue that a
cold-blooded horse can be thus preponent
is to argue against the well-known
laws of heredity!</p>

<p>“In the second place, the pacer has
undoubtedly come to stay. The American
people are nothing if not quick in realizing
real merit and honoring it when
clearly proven. As they make no pretensions
to the shams of royalty, so are
they not bound by the iron rules of court
custom from ‘hustling’ to horse-racing.
They do not care for so much trappy
action; nor does the matter of a banged
tail cut as much of a figure in their
calculations as does the intense patriotism
which lies within them for their
own almighty dollar. Passing over the
generally admitted fact that the pacer
is naturally faster than the trotter, comes
to his speed more quickly, may be more
evenly matched in a race, and is preserved
longer by reason of the smoothness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
of his gait, there is yet another
cause why the pacer is destined to become
more popular.</p>

<p>“A great English commoner, whose ire
had been aroused on one occasion by a
member of the House of Lords, in reply,
in a speech of burning oratory, spoke
of the aforesaid gentleman as being in
his titled position merely by reason of
the fact that he was ‘the accident of
an accident.’ There is no doubt that
Hambletonian 10, the present head of
the trotting family, was even more of
an accident than the English lord was.
Bellfounder mares of trotting propensities
were rarer than imported Messengers,
and if the mating of Abdallah
with this mare was not an accident,
but the plan of a thoughtful intellect
looking to the future, the descendants
of the man who thought it out should
have risen up and told it last month,
that their forefathers might have been
honored along with Columbus at the
opening of the World’s Fair. Now the
‘trotting-bred pacer’ is quite an accident
himself. He is here by reason of the
fact that many trotting breeders in their
wild vagaries and theories regarding the
best way to breed a trotter, ranging all
the way, in the theory of breeding, from
thoroughblood to jackass, have accidentally
honored a few thousand pacing
mares with a service to some of their
Hambletonians. As a result the ‘trotting-bred’
pacer is with us. As it is
quite impossible for the trotting turf
to get rid of this rascal if they wished
to, and as he has managed to be quite
a game and fast money-making machine
himself, he has clinched the popularity of
the pacer as a pacer and has stuck
a peg in the map of popular favor that
would be hard to be removed.</p>

<p>“And it is safe to say that by reason of
the blood of Pilot, Jr., Clay, Blue Bull,
Tom Hal, Pocahontas and many others
being so generally distributed in the pedigrees
of trotters, the ‘trotting-bred pacer’
will continue to come from such trotting
sources in the future in geometrical proportion
and to pace in the same ratio.
What will be done with them? Each
one, with speed, is simply a money-making
machine, and his owner will not
be long in putting him at the work which
nature cut out for him. To destroy him
merely because he paces belongs to the
dark ages when the pacing gait was
one which made no money, but now, since
the pacing purses have gotten to be so
liberal and getting more so each year,
it is only common sense to suppose that
owners of pacing horses will begin to
take more pains in their development and
their breeding. This will improve their
speed. As it is now, we do not suppose
there is a betting horseman alive who
would not give large odds that the pacer
will be the first two-minute horse.</p>

<p>“And in this connection another thing
must be taken into consideration. The
pacer’s gait has itself been greatly improved
in the last ten years. He is no
longer the rotary-motioned mud-flinger
of old, whose forefeet pawed the air
in circles parallel with and above his
ears, while his hind feet described semicircles
over the ground, but he is now
a smooth-gaited, straightforward, quick-actioned
fellow, with plenty of knee action
in front and the stride of a bullfrog
behind, and at his highest speed it requires
more than a glance for one to
say whether he is trotting or pacing. In
other words, the pacer has come to be
a well-rounded, symmetrical and well-bred
horse. His gait is the poetry of
harness motion, his courage is unquestioned
and his staying qualities, especially
with the pacing-bred ones, of whom
we are more familiar, are equal to those
of any horse that ever stretched his neck
in the home stretch. In view of these
facts it doesn’t require even the grandson
of a prophet to predict he is destined
to a still greater career on the light
harness race course.</p>

<p>“We can only judge the future by the
past and the present, and with that in
view from a study of the 2:20 list, which
a most exclusive list in the light harness
race course, we are startled with the
enviable position the despised side-wheeler
holds in that charmed circle
this season. There can be no sham in
the 2:20 list. A horse must be able to
trot or pace that enters it. Up to November
15 there were, according to the statistics
at my command, 189 new 2:20 performers;
and by new performers we
mean horses that had no record as good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
as 2:30 trotting or 2:25 pacing before
the opening of this season. Of these 189
new 2:20 performers we find that the
pacers constitute 128 of the number,
while the trotters are credited with sixty-one.
This table includes but seven pacers
that have lowered their records from
the 2:30 list last year to the 2:20 list
this year, and we use it to get at the
number of green horses to enter this
list, and <i>from</i> it we are able <i>to form</i> a
more correct idea of the material coming
fresh from both ranks. It cuts off such
stars as Kremlin, Stamboul and Nancy
Hanks among trotters, as well as Hal
Pointer, Mascot, Guy, Direct and Storm
among pacers.</p>

<p>“But a still more exclusive list is the
2:15 class, and in order to show your
readers what has been accomplished by
the new material from the pacing ranks
this year as compared with the same
material from the trotters, we publish
that list in full, and in a spirit of generosity
we place the despised pacer on
the left in the goat’s place. The fact
that it looks something like the last electoral
college, with Cleveland on the pacer’s
side, need not lead any one to think
we are at all partisan in this matter.</p>

<p>“Total number of pacers not having a
record of 2:30 or better in 1891, but now
having a record of 2:15 or better, thirty-four;
total number of trotters, four.
Finally, when we consider the fact that
a very much larger number of trotters
are trained, or attempted to be trained,
than pacers, these figures become still
more expressive of the great future possibilities
lying within the pacer’s reach

<p>What wonderful progress has been the
pacer’s since the above was written! If
we were to attempt to publish the 2:15

the Monthly, there being now about five
thousand, while the 2:10 list surpasses
belief. Three of them have paced miles
better than two minutes, and such names
as Star Pointer, Joe Patchen, John R.
Gentry, Direct, Robert J. and others have
made the turf bright with glorious deeds.
Truly the pacer’s development surpasses
even prophecy!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Do_Farmers_Think">Do Farmers Think?</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">S. W. Warfield</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">This pertinent question was suggested
by a conversation between a young
farmer—a college graduate—and a young
man who had just received his diploma
from one of the leading agricultural colleges
of the country. When questioned
by the former as to what vocation he
expected to follow, the latter said: “I
guess I’ll be a farmer, because farmers
don’t have to think.” Was the young
man correct? After a day’s journey
through the country a very observant and
thoughtful man will be forced to acknowledge
that a great many farmers
do not seem to think. The amount of
high-priced machinery allowed to rust
and ruin in the fields, the haphazard way
in which grain and hay is stacked, the
utter indifference displayed in plowing
land and laying off rows, the disregard
that is paid to the washing away of the
soil, soil that was thousands of years
in forming, the fertility of which depends
upon the actions of the elements for generations;
a soil that, when once gone, is
gone forever. We are forced to admit
that all farmers do not think. When
we see farmers burning straw stacks
or filling gullies with manure, which will
soon rot, float off and carry all accumulated
soil with it, we know in that particular
they do not think. For when a
gully is stopped with manure, it is only
a question of time before it will have
to be stopped again, and the next time
the task will be greater, for there will not
be much adjoining soil with which to
stop it.</p>

<p>When we see a farmer delving with his
whole household from daybreak till dark,
denying his children the privilege of a
common school education, trusting to luck
and brawn to carry them through life,
we have another illustration of a farmer
who does not think. For if he would
but think, he would realize that his sons,
after he was dead and gone, would prove
easy victims to the oily tongued sharper
and his hard-earned dollars would go
soon to swell the coffers of another man’s
son.</p>

<p>A great many farmers do not think,
and to them rightly belongs the disrespectful
epithets of “Reuben” and “Hay-seed.”</p>

<p>Admitting the foregoing, we are glad
to know that there are a great many
farmers who keep abreast the times, are
thoughtful and studious men.</p>

<p>With the vast area of fertile soil capable
of producing vastly more of any crop
than is needed, which fact is almost every
year proven, with a herd of middlemen
manipulating the crop reports and
combining to put and keep prices down;
with this country a network of railroads,
one and all of them clamoring for freight
to haul; with shrewd managers to concoct
the “rebate scheme” to counteract
the “Interstate Commerce Law” and
“Railroad Commission,” put the farmer
of any section in direct competition with
the whole country. When the above facts
are considered, it certainly behooves every
farmer to “think” and study so that
the thinking will be on sure footing.</p>

<p>No matter what the past has been,
the day of haphazard farming for
success and competency is gone. Farming
to-day is a scientific problem, and
a problem that requires all the thought
that can be bestowed upon it. Not a
thought for to-day or to-morrow, but
long-headed thought that studies the supply
and demand of the year ahead before
planting largely of any one crop or
launching into any new enterprise. He
must study the supply and price before
he can tell whether to hold wheat or
longer feed his cattle; must know the
needs and study the rotation to get the
best results from each crop; must think
to be able to properly harvest and care
for each crop as it matures; must think
how best to become his own financier,
and not be controlled by any bank or supply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
merchant. He must think to live on
what he makes and make all that he
needs.</p>

<p>The life of a shrewd, thoughtful farmer
is the most independent in the world—a
life that the followers of all trades and
professions yearn for, a life acquired only
by thought. So, in answering the question,
Do farmers think? we’ll say, If
they succeed, they do.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The sexuality of plants has been
known from the time of Camerarius,
1691; and yet, what farmer looks
to the strains of the seeds he plants?
How many farmers buy their seed corn
in the ear? The fact that like begets
like should never be overlooked.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nature’s secrets, to a great extent, have
been revealed, but if the practical man
be not acquainted with the things revealed,
to what avail their revelations?
Until teacher and practical farmer are
congenial in the full sense of the word,
the power of the soil will remain unknown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Plants drink and do not eat: therefore,
Nature, although robbed by man of many
methods, and now needing man’s assistance,
still provides means of converting
insoluble elements into drinkable or
water-soluble foods. All insoluble foods
brought to the surface by plowing are
decomposed by freezes, frosts and snows,
and are acted upon by carbonic acid,
other acids, oxygen and carbonate of
lime. Again, if the soil be properly conditioned
rains will carry the acids, oxygen
and lime down below the surface to
accomplish the same end. After the end
is accomplished, the soluble foods are
brought back to the plants by capillary
attraction. Humus should be in the soil
to hold the moisture or foods coming
from above and below.</p>

<h3>War Babies.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">The most gigantic struggle of modern
times was the American Civil War.
In no other country but this, with its
breadth of conservativeness and its dearth
of caste, could the bitterness of such a war
have been so quickly forgotten. As it is
in a few more decades,
if the same spirit of
good feeling continues
to prevail, and the fanatics be allowed to
die a natural death, it will be a question
as to which side will have the most respect
for the brave men of the other. A
striking feature of the great war, to me,
has always been the unanimity with
which the entire country, with the probable
exception of the military leaders
themselves, expected the war to speedily
terminate. In the South the enlisted men
all feared it would end before they had
time to get into a rousing good battle,
and the same feeling appears to have existed
among the Northern volunteers.</p>

<p>As an illustration of this feeling in the
South, in talking to an old farmer the
other day, and he a gallant cavalryman,
who belonged to Forrest’s immortal command,
he laughingly remarked, that the
greatest number of colts he ever saw at
one time was a certain Tennessee cavalry
regiment the first year after the war.
“You see,” he said, “none of us expected
the war to last over three or six months,
and never dreamed it would go over a
year. Nearly every man in our regiment
went in on his pet saddle mare or half
thoroughbred, and fully two-thirds of us
were horse breeders, on a greater or less
scale, while at home. But the war went
on, we were ordered here and there, hundreds
of miles from home with plenty of
fighting and little else to think of. We
were kept so busy that many of us, in
fact, had forgotten all about the spring
breeding, and would have been glad if it
had forgotten about itself. But not so;
the next spring there came the colts—war
babies, to be sure—dropped into a
hard world at a cruel and unmotherly
time, and before we knew it our regiment
had more colts than we knew what
to do with. I had to send my mare home
and get a fresh mount, and the others
traded around, or left dam and colt to
shift for themselves in strange and foreign
lands. I have often wondered what
became of that crop of colts, the first
breeding venture of our regiment.”</p>

<h3>A Contest in the King’s English.</h3>

<p>There is a young darky downtown,
at a livery stable, who has been
priding himself on his ability, as he expressed
it, “ter fling English.” But he
takes no pride in it any more. Old Wash
cured him, and it happened this way:</p>

<p>“Wheneber I goes
down dar arter yo’
mare,” the old darky
said, “dis heah young
niggah gins ter fling his English ’roun’
scan’lus. I tell you, boss, I’m gittin’
tired ob dat, an’ I’m gwi’ teach ’im how
ter talk English sho’ nuff some day. I
sw’ar to you, sah,” said the old man, as
he mopped his face with his red handkerchief,
“It’s so hot I’ve mighty nigh
multerplied, an’ I’ve got de commissary
rumertism, ter boot; but jes you watch
out fur me de naixt time dat nigger ’gins
ter fling his jaw-bone ’roun’ whar I’m
standin’—jes you watch me riddle ’im
wid sintax an’ orfrography an’ sich! Jes
you watch!”</p>

<p>For several days after that I noticed
the old man studying an old Davies Geometry
and an obsolete work on synonyms,
which I had sent to the attic long ago—looking,
as he expressed it, for “some
good cuss-words to fit de ’casion.” But I
had forgotten all about it until one evening
I drove into the stable with him. A
sprightly young darky ran out, took the
mare by the bit, and patronizingly remarked:</p>

<p>“Gentermen, condescen’ to disintergrate
frum de vehicle, an’ de quadruped
shall hab my unqualified solicertashun,
wid abundance ob nutrititious ellerments.”
And he smirked at the old man
as much as to say: “Don’t dat parlyze
you, old man?”</p>

<p>“Hold on dar,” exclaimed Old Wash, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
his eyes flashed as he rose quickly to the
occasion: “Sonny,” he began witheringly,
“it is transparent to de interlactual
apprehension ob eny disinterested individual
dat de gravertashun of special
conceits described on de hypotonuse of
your simeon-headed eclipse, am entirely
too cumbershum fur de horizontal vinculum
dat circumscribes de radius ob
yo’ cocoanut-shaped trapezium, sah!”</p>

<p>“Wha—wha—what dat you say, Unker
Wash?” gasped the young darky as his
jaw began to drop.</p>

<p>“I merely riz ter interjec’ de mental
reservashun,” remarked the old man indifferently,
“dat de interlectual hemmerage
of verbosity procedin’ from de vacuum
produced by de metermorphosis ob de
origonal superstructure of de san’-stones
ob yo’ cranium, am entirely incumpatabul
wid de consterpastion of ideas generated
by de paralysis ob yo’ interlectual acumen,
sah!”</p>

<p>“Gord, what is he sayin’?” remarked
the young negro sheepishly to the crowd
that had gathered to enjoy his discomfiture.</p>

<p>“In udder words,” shot out the old man
again, “ter make hit entirely incomprehensibul
to de conglommerated hypothesis
ob yo’ trapezoidal interlec’, I simply
remarked dat de corporeal superfluerty
ob yo’ physical insigniferkance am entirely
too cumbersome fur de belly-band
ob yo’ mental confermashun, sah!”</p>

<p>Here the crowd shouted, the young
darky’s eyes looked like moons, his legs
shook, and he gasped out: “Wha—wha—what
dat old man talkin’ ’bout, man?”</p>

<p>“How long since this nigger wus cotch
in the jungles of Africa,” asked Old Wash
quietly of the proprietor of the stable,
“dat he can’t understan’ de simples’ remark
in de plaines’ of English?”</p>

<p>And then the old man tried again. He
rolled up his sleeves, and with the air
of one who was trying to make himself
exceedingly plain he began laying it off
on his fingers and palm:</p>

<p>“Sonny, de equilateral altertude of de
comprehenserbility ob my former observations
wus to de effect dat, if in de
course of a cummercial transacshun, I
shu’d onexpectedly negotiate fur yo’ habeas-corporosity
at its intrinsic invalidity
an’ quickly dispose of it at de exaggerated
hifolutiness of yo’ own colossal
conceitability an’ hipnartic expectashun
I’d have sufficient commercial collateral
to transpose my present habitation to de
perennial localization of de avenue called
Easy.”</p>

<p>By this time the young darky was
fairly groveling in the dust.</p>

<p>“Do yo’ comprehen’ dat,” yelled the old
man, “yo’ po’ benighted parallelergram,
distended from de apex of a truncated
coon (cone), yo’ bow-legged son of a
parallelopipedon—”</p>

<p>But the old man got no further with his
geometrical swearing, for amid the
shouts of the spectators his opponent had
vanished, and as he went up the street to
have the old man arrested for swearing
in public, he remarked to the policeman
as he told his tale: “I didn’t keer, Cap’n,
’bout ’im outgineralin’ me er flingin’ English,
an’ outcussin’ me in mo’ kinder newfangled
cuss words den eber cum out ob

de nigger
don’t lib dat I gwi’ take dat frum!”</p>

<p>It was a week later before Old Wash
and I had occasion to drive into the stable
again. We were met by the same darky,
who took the mare by the bit and meekly
remarked: “Light, gentlemen; I’ll take
de mair.”</p>

<p>And the old man said: “I am so excruciatinly
rejoiced, sonny, to recognize
de rejuvernated resurrection ob de exhileratin’
perception dat an infinertesermal
ray ob common sense has penertrated

words,” he winked, “I’se saved an ebononic
interlec frum er new-bohn grave.”</p>

<h3>“The Little Girl.”</h3>

<p>Pioneer days in Texas, and the prairies
unbroken by the smoke of
a single cabin. To the south the Brazos,
and to the west the buffalo lands, the
herds crawling in the distance, like huge
mud-waves on land,
toward their fall feeding
grounds.</p>

<p>There had been raids by the Comanches,
then hot fighting with the troops
and every settler west of the Brazos had
run into the fort, each with his family,
his man-servant and maid-servant, each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
with his cattle and his asses. For the
Comanches are wily devils and born horsemen.
One day they are here, and the
next they are not. And they go on ponies
that are as tough as their riders, and as
fast and as fearless, and no man knows
when and where they will strike.</p>

<p>Three full companies of troops had gone
north on the track of the desperate band
who, but a few days before, had surprised
the settlers on the upper Brazos and,
after killing and scalping and plundering,
had fled, as the troops thought, northward.
The stricken settlers had been
coming in for two days, all plundered,
tired, many wounded and some still sobbing
with the grief that would never die.</p>

<p>There were little children—motherless,
fatherless. There were mothers and
fathers who but a day before held loving
ones in their arms.</p>

<p>Troop H, 7th Regiment, was holding
the fort while the other companies went
north to avenge.</p>

<p>The First Lieutenant of Troop H was
a beardless youth just from West Point.
He had been shot out of West Point into
the saddle and to the front. Two months
of it had bronzed him and added two
years to his looks; but sentiment was
still in him and Romance claimed his for
her own. He had had enough fighting
for any ordinary trooper, but to-day he
felt sad that three companies had gone
north after the marauders and he—he
held the peaceful fort.</p>

<p>The sun was setting across the great
plains and shadows had lengthened to
their uttermost when a man on a cow-pony
galloped in, not from the north, but
from the west.</p>

<p>His pony was reeling at the first gate.
It was dead in the fort ten minutes later.
The man himself carried two Comanche
arrows sticking through a shoulder and
an arm. A gash was in his head from a
glancing arrow and blood ran from another
that had cut across his forehead.</p>

<p>He was unconscious before the surgeon
could extract the arrows from his body,
but he said enough. The Comanches
were not north, but west—they had attacked
him in his little squatter cabin
forty miles west—they had killed all his
stock but one pony—he had no family
but a little girl—he had escaped on the
pony. “An’ the little gal—God knows—I
seed her cut for a dug-out in the side
of a hill—a kind of a cellar—where I kept
pertatoes an’ sich—then—wal—”</p>

<p>He went to sleep.</p>

<p>“Let him sleep,” said the surgeon, “he
is nearly gone as it is—forty miles and
blood leakin’ out of him every jump of
the pony.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the bugler called
“boots and saddles,” and when Company
H wheeled in the fort’s square, the Captain
said:</p>

<p>“Well, men, the boys are on a cold
trail. You have heard where the devils
are; we can’t all go. Half of us must
stay behind to hold the fort. I’ll be
fair to all, for I know you all want to go,
so count by twos.”</p>

<p>“One,”</p>

<p>“Two.”</p>

<p>“One,”</p>

<p>“Two.”</p>

<p>It went down the line, one hundred
strong.</p>

<p>“Numbers Two, ten paces forward,
march!”</p>

<p>There was a happy smile on Numbers
Two as they spurred forward—they knew
what it meant. They were lucky.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, you know I want to lead
you,” went on the Captain, “but it isn’t
fair. I must take my chances, too, and
tote fair with the First Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Troup will toss up with me,”
he said with a laugh as he tossed a coin
from his saddle into the air. It flashed
high up in the sunlight.</p>

<p>“Heads for me, Lieutenant, and here’s
wishing you—”</p>

<p>“Tails!” said the soldier who picked it
up.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant flushed as he spurred
forward saluting. Then men cheered
again and the Captain wheeled, saying:</p>

<p>“Take them out, Lieutenant Troup—it’s
your luck, and maybe—ah, well, you
can’t tell how many there are, you know,
and half a company is mighty few after
sending out three troops. Leave your
trinkets, men, and any message you may
wish to send home. Yes, it’s a nasty bit
of a fight you’ll be having, likely, and I
wish it had been my luck to be in it. I
have been in service a little longer, you
know, perhaps the Lieutenant might—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>But the Lieutenant only smiled and
saluted again.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, Captain—war is on
and it’s my time, you know.”</p>

<p>The Captain pressed his hand as the
Company filed out of the fort.</p>

<p>And all the time the Lieutenant kept
thinking of the half-dead man who kept
saying even in his delirium: “An’ my
little gal—God knows—I seed her cut for
a dug-out—”</p>

<p>The Lieutenant was young—very
young—and he was romantic. He
could see the little girl—of course she
was about sixteen—all settlers called
their grown girls little. Perhaps—well—if
she hadn’t been killed—</p>

<p>The troup wanted to gallop, but the
Lieutenant brought them to a steady trot:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, men, and ten miles an
hour is fast enough. We may need
our horses for all that’s in them. We’ll
be there by midnight as it is.”</p>

<p>The moon arose and drifted higher and
higher and still the troopers struck
grimly across the plain. The wind
brought the howl of wolves—big greys—and
the yelp of coyotes, but the troopers
turned neither to the right nor left, and
the Lieutenant rode at their head, and
all the time he was wondering what had
become of the pretty girl—helpless—alone.
“An’ my little gal—God knows—I
seed her cut for a dug-out!”</p>

<p>It was the first streak of day. The
men and horses had been resting for
four hours—those not on picket, and
some had even slept and were fresh.
But the young officer could think of nothing
but the little girl, and wonder at her
fate.</p>

<p>They had lined in behind a few willows
that skirted a small stream and were
concealed from the view of the Indians.
Then they looked well to rifles and Colts.
The light came slowly and as they peered
through the mist where the cabin stood
only a burnt place blurred the dry grass
of the prairie. There were no Indians in
sight.</p>

<p>“Thar—look!”</p>

<p>It was an old Indian fighter whose keen
eyes saw it first—a thing which looked
like a potato-house butting out of a clay
bank.</p>

<p>“Thar’s life in thar—see—it’s the little
gal, an’ she’s alive yit—see!”</p>

<p>From the protection of small rises on
the right three Comanches galloped out
encircling the dug-out in a very generous
circle. They had slipped on the off-side
of their ponies and clung to mane and
neck, with one leg and heel thrust over
the flank.</p>

<p>The old fighter snarled: “The cowardly
coyotes! They seem ter be mighty
skeered of a little gal. Say, but they’ve
got a whole lot o’ respect for her; she
must have a weep’n o’ some sort in thar
an’ tort ’em a crackin’ less’n with it, or
them dogs ’ud et her up befo’ now; why—thar,
by gad—”</p>

<p>He gripped the Lieutenant’s shoulder
as a puff of smoke leaped out of the clay
bank and the foremost pony stopped so
quickly that it went down, Comanche
under.</p>

<p>“She’s killed that Indian sho’,” cried
the old hunter in a whisper. “No live
Comanche was ever cocht under a fallin’
pony. See.”</p>

<p>The pony sprang quickly up—the bullet
had creased him; but marvelous the
shot!—it had gone to the exact spot
where it would bring down a pony creased
and a rider with a hole through his head.</p>

<p>“That’s shootin’ some,” cried the old
hunter as the young officer gave the
quick commands:</p>

<p>“Ready!”</p>

<p>“Mount!”</p>

<p>“Charge!”</p>

<p>“An’ remember the little gal!” they
shouted as they broke across the plains.</p>

<p>It was a running fight and the Indians
taken by surprise, for they were after
the thing in the dug-out. And they paid
for it—sixteen dead ones in the first half
mile. The others—they had enough to
get away from the forty troopers who
shot as they rode and shot to kill.</p>

<p>Then the Lieutenant and ten men rode
back to the dug-out. They approached it
slowly—reverently, and all the time the
young officer was thinking of dark eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
and auburn curls and the beauty and
bravery of the little girl.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he shouted, his voice trembled
in spite of himself. “Hello!—we’re
your friends.”</p>

<p>“Hello, yo’self—mighty glad to see
you.”</p>

<p>“It’s the little girl, men,” shouted the
Lieutenant, boyishly, as he rushed up.
“She’s safe! hurrah!” and they gave it
with a ring.</p>

<p>At the door he stopped short and looked
into the hole under the potato-house.</p>

<p>Then his romance went out as the tide
to the sea.</p>

<p>A woman at least thirty-five stood
there. Her hair was red, her features
hard, her face burned by the sun. Grim,
square jaws set off her face. There was
a line only to show where her lips met in
deadly determination. She wore moccasins
and leggins, a short skirt of deer
skin and she held in her hand a rifle that
had sent a dozen Indians to death in the
twelve long hours she had held the little
fort. Stuck in her belt were two good
pistols. A thousand Comanches with arrows
and antiquated guns could not have
taken her.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said, “but I’m glad to see
you. Say, but I stood ’em off all right,
didn’t I? It was awful—’specially last
night, but the moon riz an’ saved me, for
a Comanche with an arrow or a old gun
is kinder techus ’bout a rifle. Is Pap
safe?”</p>

<p>They told her he was.</p>

<p>“I tried to git the old fool to stay. I
told him all hell couldn’t git us out o’
this hole, armed as we wus, lessen they
come with bilin’ water,” she laughed,
“but he got panicky an’ vamoosed on
the only pony left. Dad allers was a
gal.”</p>

<p>“Good gad,” cried the old hunter
bluntly at last, “an’ is you the little gal
he kip talkin’ ’bout?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he allers called me that,” she
smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re the gamest little gal I
ever seed,” and he wrung her hand while
the others followed suit. “An’ you’re our
little gal now,” went on the old hunter,
proudly, “an’ as I ain’t seed one like you
since mine died years ago, I’d—I’d—I’d
lak to kiss you jes onct for her,” he
stammered.</p>

<p>“Oh, you shet up,” she said hotly.
“D’ye think I stood off a lot o’ Comanches
all night to be rewarded by kissin’
a old grizzly like you? But say,” she
added, hesitating, and with a laugh, “I
wouldn’t mind kissin’ that pretty little
boy thar!”</p>

<p>There was a wild shout from the men,
but the young Lieutenant had turned to
mount his horse.</p>

<p>“Any way you belong to Company H,”
said the old hunter.</p>

<h3>A Preface.</h3>

<p>At the request of the ladies of a church
in Marion, Alabama, Trotwood wrote the
following Preface, a few weeks ago for
a cook-book which the ladies
are publishing with a view
of paying off a church debt:</p>

<p>The climate, the soil, the very air play
their part in the art of good recipes.
The cooking of the North and West is
very different from that of the South, for
Southern recipes are the products of sunshine
and Southlands, of culture, of rest,
of the Old South.</p>

<p>And nowhere has the Old South flowered
to sweeter perfume than in my
native town of Marion. Macaulay’s New
Zealander, if placed in Delmonico’s
would straightway beckon for cold clam,
and good King Edward, if stranded in
New Zealand, would soon fish an oyster
cocktail out of some unruffled kiss of the
sea.</p>

<p>Recipes, indeed, are a test of one’s
civilization—one’s religion—one’s mentality.
They are the products of the
centuries beginning with the primitive
clam and ending with the thousand glories
of the oyster. They are the literature
of the laughter which comes with
good eating, the bon mots of jolly stomachs,
the sparkle of centuries of good
cheer, the morals of mucous membranes,
the religion of healthy livers.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb tells us that roast pig,
for instance, was accidentally discovered
by the primitive man in the burning of
his crude stable in which was a litter of
pigs. After that, fires were frequent and
log stables few. And I doubt not if the
history of every good recipe in this splendid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
collection were traced to its birth,
it would show an unbroken line of progress
as clearly defined as Magna Charta.</p>

<p>Think not lightly, then, of the book,
for you have in your hand the concentrated
perfection of the culinary ages.
The dash of Caesar into Briton, the
strength of the Dane, the brilliancy of
the Norman, the excellency of Angle and
Saxon, the glory of the English and the
old Scotch. It is history, religion, progress.
It is a novel more interesting
than all novels, a poem which made Tennyson
possible.</p>

<p>I have not read these recipes. I speak
from higher authority. I have tasted
them. From my infancy up I have known
them. They are part of my life and this
article returned to them is a feeble result
of their cause. They are interwoven
with the memory of my home, in the
song of the pine tree, in the opal gleam
of the old red hills, in the sweetness, the
culture, the religion of Marion. And to-night,
should Abou Ben Adhem’s Angel
come to me and ask for the name of
one blessed beyond his dues, I would
answer: “It is I, O Angel, blessed beyond
words in the mother I had, in the
father; blessed in my birthplace, in the
people among whom I grew up, in the
moral sweetness of their schools and
churches, blessed that I was born in</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Tennessee_Jersey">The Tennessee Jersey</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By W. J. Webster.</span></p>

<p class="note">NOTE.—Mr. W. J. Webster developed
two of the three greatest cows of the
world to championship honors, and has
made more great churn tests than, perhaps,
any other living man. His experience
is of the practical kind.—Ed.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">This has become a well-known name
among Jersey cattle breeders of the
United States and frequently used in
advertising strains of blood by the various
owners. This is easily accounted
for by the high stand taken by Jersey
cows owned, developed and bred in Tennessee.
Many years ago the pioneer
breeders of this favorite dairy breed of
cattle, Major Campbell Brown, Judge
Thos. H. Malone, M. C. Campbell, M.
M. Gardner, and the writer of this article,
W. J. Webster, built their herds on
a very solid foundation:</p>

<p>First—Constitution and ability to stand
long continued high feed.</p>

<p>Second—Richness of milk as well as
quantity, but with the goal always centered
on production of butter as ascertained
by actual test, without any instrument,
calculation or guess work. The
churn was adopted as a test system.</p>

<p>Third—Beauty, symmetry and general
conformity. We early in our course of
breeding determined that beauty of cattle
should not be ignored, but was an
element certainly in the sale. Therefore,
Tennessee Jerseys were bred for
all these qualities claimed and I do not
think that anywhere in the United States
a more uniform or more beautiful set
of animals could be found.</p>

<p>The Middle Basin of Tennessee is especially
adapted to the breeding, rearing
and developing of this cow. We
have here the elements of the soil entering
into the blood of the animal which
I think develops them more highly than
in any other portion of the United States.
We have lime rock and bone phosphate
of lime entering into the water they
drink, and the bluegrass and other grasses
that they eat, corn, oats and hay
consumed by them, and also mingled with
enough iron so that the very highest
opportunities are available for their
growth. This thought applies not alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
to the Jersey cow but to the whole animal
kingdom as evidenced by the fact
that some of the finest race horses in
the world, either running or pacing
horses, have been developed in this Middle
Basin of Tennessee. In point of climate
we are exceptionally well located, all
things considered, about the same as
the Isle of Jersey, the original home of
the Jersey cow. No wonder then that
with the additional advantages of our
soil mentioned above the Jersey has developed
wonderfully in Tennessee.</p>

<p>The question is sometimes asked why
prices have declined the last twelve or
fifteen years. My reply is that prices
have not declined all over the United
States, but that the old breeders have
dropped out in Tennessee and that there
are now very few breeders in Tennessee
paying any attention to the development
of the Jersey cow. Recently Messrs.
Overton and Gardner, of Nashville, have
begun to pay more attention to it and
I predict that if this is continued the
prices will again rise for they have not
fallen in New York and other centers,
but the present year sales are higher than
they have ever been at auction, as shown
by the general average at the Cooper
sale of over six hundred dollars per head,
a single animal bringing ten thousand
dollars and that in a sale of over a hundred
animals. So it is not a declining
in the prices of the breed cattle but simply
a lack of driving their interests in
Tennessee.</p>

<p>The system of testing Jerseys and
knowing exactly what they were capable
of doing did more to develop them than
anything else. The American is always
an eminently practical man and wants
to know what he is doing instead of
guessing. The Tennessee breeders inaugurated
this test system, Messrs.
Campbell Brown, Thos. H. Malone, M.
M. Gardner and W. J. Webster having
edited the first compilation of test in the
United States as a venture of their own
and at their own risk and expense; then
turned it over to the Club of American
Jersey Cattle Breeders, and the work
has been continued by the club since that
time. Prior to this time tests were reported
to newspapers and frequently
tests were claimed for ancestors of cattle
that subsequent research showed
were either tests for one day multiplied
by seven, making it an estimate test, or
in some instances that they did not exist
at all. It therefore required a large
amount of labor to run down by correspondence
all this and procure from their
owners the actual tests, and these were
published with the tabulated pedigree of
the cow. This work caused a boom in
the Jersey family shown to be prominent,
and this has continued all along where
they were pushed and developed. Tennessee
breeders were fortunate in having
laid well their foundation as it was
based on such cows as Landseer’s Fancy,
Oonan, Duchess of Bloomfield, Beeswax,
Kate Gordon and other prominent and
beautiful cows and it so happened that
the cows named possessed all the requisites,
constitution, richness and beauty,
and no money was spared in heading the
herd with such animals as Imported Tormentor,
Signalda, Ida’s Stoke Pogis, Gold
Basis, Southern Prince and other noted
animals too numerous to mention. From
these came what is known as the Tennessee
Jerseys, possessing constitution,
richness and beauty. As proof of the
wonderful development of these cows any
person who desires to be informed has
only to consult the test books in charge
of the American Jersey Cattle Club to
find that the richest cattle ever bred,
owned and developed were in Tennessee:
Bisson’s Belle with the yearly test of
1,028 pounds and fifteen ounces, that
held the champion cup, was developed
in Tennessee; Landseer’s Fancy tested
936 pounds fourteen and three-quarter
ounces in one year, was developed in
Tennessee and held the cup. She and
her descendants are known for their extreme
richness: so marvelously rich that
they were compelled to demonstrate their
ability to make this test again and again,
a number of times by official tests, by disinterested
committees and verified by
chemical analysis.</p>

<p>I could not in this article undertake to
give a list of Jersey cows from Tennessee
in the honor roll, but only mention a
few of the prominent ones: Ethleel the
Second, 30 pounds 15 ounces at two and
one-half years old; Landseer’s Fancy, 29<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
pounds one-half ounce; Bisson’s Belle,
28 pounds 10 ounces; Toltec’s Fancy, 27
pounds 5½ ounces—this cow was officially
tested by the Alabama experiment
station and Major Campbell Brown, and
her milk analyzed at Vanderbilt University
confirms the test showing butter
fat 16.32 per cent, equivalent to one
pound of butter to 4.79 of milk; Oonan,
22 pounds 2½ ounces; Duchess of Bloomfield,
20 pounds one-half ounce; Cherokee
Rose, 23 pounds 10 ounces. And I might
continue even from memory, as this
article is dictated from memory (no
records being before me), and give a
long list. But for the purposes of this
article it would be useless and simply a
compilation that the people would not
read, so I only call attention to the fact
that the champion cup, a large silver urn
costing five hundred dollars, was held
only four times in all; twice in Tennessee
against the whole United States.
But to prove that the Tennessee Jersey
has life in any other hands, scattered
far and wide over the United States we
have only to look at the work of the
last great test at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition at St. Louis to show
what their descendants have done.</p>

<p>The American Jersey Cattle Club has
published a pamphlet giving the work
of the Jersey team of twenty-five selected
from all over the United States under a
committee appointed by the American
Jersey Cattle Club which showed no
favoritism, but the cows were judged for
entrance into this team by preliminary
tests at St. Louis and then the team selected
by a committee. It ought to be
very gratifying to the old breeders in
Tennessee to analyze this pamphlet and
find that the cattle bred, owned and
developed in Tennessee have, through
their descendants, put their mark on
thirteen of the twenty-five. It certainly
is very pleasant to the writer of this to
find that Tormentor, owned by Major
Campbell Brown, placed his mark on
twelve of the twenty-five; Landseer’s
Fancy, owned by the writer, on seven;
Oonan, six; Toltec’s Fancy, four. Only
one other cow in the United States, of
co-temporaneous age, competes with
them with six, this cow Erotas.</p>

<p>It is also to be noted that No. 1 of the
team of twenty-five champion over own
team, the champion cow of all breeds at
the World’s Fair, is a descendant from
cattle owned, bred and developed by old
Tennessee breeders. I do not mean, of
course, that she is composed entirely of
this blood, but she takes her line directly
back from Chemical Test bred in
Tennessee, son of Toltec’s Fancy, that
in turn was daughter of Landseer’s
Fancy. So carrying the blood of Tormentor,
Landseer’s Fancy and Oonan.</p>

<p>Then permit an old breeder to make
the suggestion that what has been done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
once could be done now even to greater
advantage if taken up and the proper
amount of energy, zeal and intelligence
bestowed upon it. Prices would again
revive and Jersey interests in Tennessee
would again develop. Why should young
breeders of the country neglect the natural
advantages we have, backed by experience
and the development of the
breed already accomplished? I think if
there ever was a time that is exceedingly
favorable for this industry it is
now.</p>

<p>Commencing with Landseer’s Fancy,
then giving about thirty pounds of milk
per day, which made under test 14
pounds 6 ounces in one week, I fed
and developed her through a long series
of years, using more and more concentrated
food and less bran, until in the
end she was capable of digesting two
gallons at a feed, equal parts corn and
oats, with one-half gallon of bran (pure
wheat bran), and when making her maximum
amount of butter—29 pounds one-half
ounce—was giving only from twenty
to twenty-three pounds of milk per
day, and subsequently went as low as
seventeen or eighteen pounds of milk per
day, holding her own with regard to the
butter. So it will be seen that from the
commencement she lost in quantity of
milk, but under such feed gained in butter.
Her milk was so remarkably rich
as also her daughter, Toltec’s Fancy’s
milk, that, for a long time having the
test questioned notwithstanding the
fact that she had always proven by repeated
official tests all claims made for
her, finally resorted to glass jars made
of heavy glassware wherein her whole
milk was placed after each milking and
placed under seal as usual in official
tests so that when lifted from the water
the line of cream and milk would be
seen, and it was demonstrated that it
was almost entirely cream, being about
three-fourths to seven-eighths cream.
This cow was exceptional, or I might say,
her whole family was exceptional in such
remarkable rich production. But she
handed down to her descendants the same
tendency to richness in other hands long
years afterwards. She has two sons with
over seventy daughters in the honor roll
of the Jerseys, and five daughters all in
the fourteen-pound class and upwards,
and it would be hard to give a list of her
descendants in the fourteen-pound class.
I should say something over two hundred.
This cow, with others handled by me, was
fed according to the capacity of each cow
to digest the corn and oats ground together,
with grass, hay and running
water at will. On this point I cannot too
strongly emphasize the fact that Tennessee
is better located and supplied
with running water than any place I
have ever seen. With all the bluegrass
and other facilities of Kentucky, Ohio,
Illinois and Indiana, they lack running
water for the cows to drink and the
running water to set the milk in.</p>

<p>I have tried every known experiment
in raising the cream on the milk for the
best results, but in all I have ever tried
I have never found anything equal to the
stone spring-house with wire gauze over
the windows to keep out all insects,
ceiled overhead with plank (not plastered),
and set the milk in jars, either
stone or glass, when first drawn from
the cow warm, in the water about 56 to
59 degrees temperature. The temperature
of the milk soon becomes the same
temperature as the water and remains
stationary until all the cream is raised
in the milk. The current of water keeps
the air in the spring-house fresh and
clean and every facility is given for the
production of butter.</p>

<p>In building the various spring-houses
that I used on the different farms at
different times, I always used what is
known as the test-room, about six feet
wide across the entire spring-house, a
wall of brick or stone cemented inside
and out, with only one door and window
in the same, both of which could be
placed under seal by any committee
called to test the cattle at any time, or
used by myself and manager in making
private tests, so that the milk of the cow
under test could be kept absolutely untampered
with by any person. And the
tests made by me were made in this way
and verified by various committees and
also by chemical analysis. So that when
I went out of breeding Jerseys I know
that I had more official tests than any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
Jersey breeder, and probably at one time
as much as all combined.</p>

<p>I believe in the theory that especial
families of Jerseys are capable of being
fed so as to grow richer after long continued
feed. Some will not. There is a
limit that will be found in nearly all of
them.</p>

<p>In testing cattle it was always my
purpose to ascertain the maximum of
food capable of being digested by any
cow under test, and fall slightly below
this quantity of feed so as to keep her
appetite always whetted.</p>

<p>Another point was that she be fed
regularly and preferably, not over twice
a day with concentrated foods, and thus
giving the stomach all the time to do its
work. I have seen many a test disturbed
by feeding only a small amount of grain
at the dinner time out of order. It disturbs
the entire digesting of the animals
and will probably throw them off a day
or two. When undisturbed, the same cow
will come up at night and take her
regular feed and not be disturbed in her
test at all. It may be thought that this
is going into detail too much, but small
details sometimes have wonderful influence
in handling any animal. A horse
may be just on edge for a race and some
small circumstance occur that disturbs it.
So with the wonderful mechanism of the
cow making her four pounds of butter
per day, she must be handled very carefully.</p>

<p>But it may be said, what profit is there
in all this? My reply is that if Landseer’s
Fancy had not been tested as she
was and thoroughly developed her descendants
might have passed unnoticed
and we would have been none the wiser
as to the capabilities of this family. I
have taken her as an instance because
more familiar with her history than
others, and because she was the hub
around which the herd revolved. I paid
$175 for her, and, on calculation of her
descendants owned by me and sold to
others, she realized nearly $30,000 without
any calculation as to her milk and
butter. She entered into and formed
the web and woof of what was known as
The Columbia Jersey Cattle Company’s
herd. She was sold subsequently when
that corporation was wound up to Messrs.
Webster and Morrow and entered the
great herd at Nashville.</p>

<p>This Columbia Jersey Cattle Company
organized with a capital stock of $20,000,
paid a dividend of 14 per cent or over
per annum, and the stock was retired at
par with all debts paid; one of the most
successful of all Jersey cattle enterprises
I was ever in. I think the last
year, with about thirty working cows
and the dairy receipts of thirty-six hundred
dollars and over and the sales of
calves and cattle from the herd, with the
herd products and heifers added, was
something over ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>It was then located at Indian Camp
Springs, about three miles from Columbia
and an ideal place for a spring-house,
the spring being about fifty nine feet
above the spring-house and coming to
the spring-house through a four inch
pipe, but the water had to be cut off so
that it would run slowly into the spring-house,
and when we wanted to work the
butter in the churn it would be turned
on into the hose and the butter thoroughly
washed.</p>

<p>Young breeders cannot adopt a better
formula for feed than the one I have
suggested, which is cheap also in the
long run, for it is a farm product and it
is not necessary to buy on the market,
but it can be produced on the farm. Besides
this, no cow will stand commercial
feed as she will this corn and oats in
equal parts. It is nearer suited to nature
and she can stand this feed longer
without injury than any commercial food.
When I say corn and oats in equal parts
I mean bushel for bushel mixed and
ground together. If any one will think
a minute there is nothing deleterious in
this food. You can get it absolutely pure,
whereas if you go to market to buy bran
to feed the cattle on you do not know
what you are getting, sometimes the
sweeping of the mill floor and any old
waste the miller is pleased to throw off.
The Jersey breeder ought essentially to
be a farmer and raise on his own farm
what his herd consumes and thus market
the products of the farm.</p>

<h3>A PRAIRIE CHICKEN HUNT IN NORTH DAKOTA.</h3>

<p class="center">By Trotwood.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Every citizen of this great republic
should travel over his own country.
He will be amazed at its greatness, and
his prejudices and local conceits, if he
have any breadth at all, will grow fewer
the further he goes, and learns that the
world cares nothing for the petty environments
and embroilments of his own
bailiwick.</p>

<p>The most attractive country in the
Northwest is the great prairies of the
Dakotas. I thought I had some idea of
their immensity, of their greatness, until
for one solid day and night I raced across
them by fast express, and saw by day
the pillar of their cloud of smokestacks—for
it was harvest time—on each side,
as far as the boundless horizon, and each
cloud a thresher from whose funnel
poured the wheat of the nation.</p>

<p>There is something in mere land to
me—any kind of land—soil, you may call
it—dirt—I care not what. But I love
it just as I hate brick walls and
city pavements. There is something
about it, from the rocks and hills to the
level, plowed valleys, that is clean and
good. It means independence and honesty
and clean living. It may not mean
shrewdness and polish and that smart
education which comes from living by
one’s wits in a great walled-in home of
wits, but it means independence and the
rest that made Shakespeare.</p>

<p>When I saw the Dakotas, I wondered
how the white man had stayed away
from them as long as he had. Perhaps
it were better for the staying, starving,
striving quality of our forefathers that
this grand garden spot of the Northwest
lay hid between the mountains and
the sea, instead of stretching up and
down the coast. It were better for their
children that fathers should toil in sand
and flint. It puts flint into the children—steel—gameness—the
spirit to do.</p>

<p>One generation of striving poverty
makes flint; two, steel; three, well, you
have heard of Andrew Jackson, of Lincoln,
perhaps. Study the poverty of
their pedigrees, for it takes poverty to
make a pedigree.</p>

<p>The first immigrants to our shores
came solely for gold, it is said. What
kind of a republic would we have to-day
if they had landed on the Pacific slope of
gold instead of the Atlantic slope of
rocks?</p>

<p>And yet, America is run over with people
to-day who think that gold is everything.
They think it so hard that the
land is filled with trusts and steals and
the things which breed greed and guilt.
They should learn—they must learn—that,
as the making of money is the lowest
of all human talents—the talent of
self first, which is the lowest instinct of
all life—so is its talent for getting the
lowest, meanest of all talents. “All my
life,” says Edison, “I have been trying
to keep away from mean people who
make money.”</p>

<p>Fargo I found to be a beautiful and
prosperous city, and the soil of the country
around it, as it had been for two
hundred miles, truly a glory and an
inspiration. If this land had the climate
of the South it could feed the world.
As it is, Nature, who adjusts herself
to environments, acts quickly here, and
I was surprised at the stories of its
productiveness in the short season it
had. Nay, mine own eye beheld it, for
never had I seen such wheat, barley
and small grain, such cabbage, beets,
turnips, vegetables of all kinds.</p>

<p>There was a greatness and vastness
everywhere. As far as the eye could
see, even beyond the rim of the horizon,
it was vast—vast. And that always
affects me peculiarly. After I have seen
as far as the eye will reach, I become
homesick. I have a sacred, sad longing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
to see and go farther and uplift the
veil.</p>

<p>I rejoiced in the fact that there were
no trees, no high hills, nothing to break
the great canvas of vastness—a bivouac
of eternity dotted with millions of camps
of wheat shocks, fringed with the
splendor of a vast, pure sky, and framed
in the purpling splendor of a horizon
of blue and gold. The little ten acre lots
of dwarf trees the Government has
forced the settlers to plant, I liked them
not. They were warts, merely, on the
brow of Eternity. The great, rich, boundless,
beautiful prairies were there as
God had Intended them to be—Nature’s
handiwork, with splendid harmony in its
whole.</p>

<p>No picture ever painted has equalled
it—for Nature never makes a mistake
in her pictures. She never sticks a
bunch of dwarf trees where the great,
grand prairies should roll away.</p>

<p>There is but little difference between
the Dakota prairies and the ocean. The
difference is that only between the
imagination and the fact. And looking
over them, standing in them, seeing the
ceaseless waves rippling across the seas
of wheat or the white caps come spinning
from the uplifted heads of them,
again and again I caught myself repeating
Byron’s lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty’s form</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Glasses itself in tempests, in all time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Calm or convulsed, in breeze or gale or storm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Dark heaving;—boundless, endless and sublime—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The image of Eternity—the throne</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The monsters of the deep are made; each zone</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Obeys thee; thou goest forth, dread fathomless, alone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lisbon is a beautiful little town, and
one comes upon it so suddenly it is a
surprise. For hours nothing but the
grand, great prairies, billowed in wheat
waves, smoke-plumed with thresher
stacks. Then down you go into a beautiful
valley—the valley of the Cheyenne,
and nestling on its banks clean, church-spired,
sits this up-to-date town.</p>

<p>I landed in good luck there, for I had
anticipated the pleasure of meeting old
friends and relatives—a cousin whom
my mother had reared and who to me
had always been a sister—but I had the
additional good luck to fall into the
hands of Mr. Geo. W. Ferguson, the county
treasurer, and the owner of Raymond
S. by Montevideo, the handsomest young
trotting sire it has been my good
fortune to see in any State. And
I found the blooded stock interest alive
and growing in all that section, and
surely no place under the skies has a
better license to rear them. In the
hands of Mr. Ferguson and Mr. W. B.
Stone, the county game-warden, I realized
one of the dreams of my life—a
prairie chicken shoot. If you have never
indulged in one, go a thousand miles
to Dakota—and every year will find you
wanting to go again. It was a bright,
crisp morning in September, and Mr.
Stone’s beautiful setter bitch was good
and fit. I had been out early to see
some threshers at work in the wheat,
and a little shower coming up I had gotten
wet. This in the South would have
meant two hours’ dampness, and a cold,
but imagine my surprise, in a short
while, to find the ground dry and myself
with it, very dry! In the rarefied air of
this great country I do not believe one
can get wet unless he is foolish enough
to drink water.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson met me later with his
surrey and two spanking red-sorrel trotting
mares, as well bred as Raymond S,
and away we went across the prairie
after the chickens. The ride itself was
pleasure enough—forever going through
that beautiful black loam, as tempting
to the eye of the man who loves the soil
as a cobwebbed bottle or a fat capon to
the stomach of a priest. For it was
bespangled with red berries, ripe heads
of flax, golden stubbles of wheat and oats
and barley, red grasses finer than ever
bluegrass grows to be and richer than all
tame blades.</p>

<p>My first covey is pictured forever in
my mind. The bitch came to a staunch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
stand near a low, marshy place, where
the grass was blue green and studded
with fall flowers. On all sides were
shocks of wheat, and away in the distance
the interminable smokestacks of
busy threshers. I walked up and took
it all in—I stamped the picture forever
on my mind. I wanted it there
that I might always see it—the very
clouds, the distant horizon, the golden
stubble-blades, the very silence that
hangs like a benediction over the land.
And all over it and above everything
that beautiful Llewellyn bitch, frozen in
living marble before me.</p>

<p>“Is it possible,” I thought, “that nothing
is between these birds and me but
the air?” No pines of Alabama and
Mississippi, no thickets on the creeks of
Louisiana, no wooded lots and big hills
of Tennessee, no barb-wire fence with
hideous signs stuck up warning me that
some hog lived there on posted land?
All my life I had shot quail under those
conditions. Now—now—nothing but me
and the pure, clear air and the boundless,
rolling prairies and that dog of
marble waiting for the word, to flush a
dozen prairie hens squatting in the stubble
ready to rise with a cyclone’s rush on
wings of thunder. I stood frozen—like
the dog. I could not move. My heart
beat like a race-horse in the back stretch,
making me take long breaths and swallow
hard as I came to the hunter’s attention.
Then!—</p>

<p>Never arose before mortal man so
thrilling a sight. They sucked me forward
like the gust of a passing express,
like the roar of a wind storm, like the
burst of sun from a cloud, thunder-lined.
The earth of stubble quivered to their
wings of thunder and the air pulsed like
a man-of-war when the big guns bellow
to port.</p>

<p>But I did not forget to fire—oh, no!
Man is a killing animal by instinct, and
a hog by nature, and neither poetry nor
romance nor the wild glory of the great
fields can stop him from killing when his
killing blood is up and his stomach is
at stake. Yes, I fired—once—twice—and
I shot to kill. Two beautiful ones I
picked with lightning glance from the
splendid covey—two glorious ones that
fairly split the air in the wild joy of
escape, only suddenly to—</p>

<p>Well, “the rest is silence,” as Shakespeare
said, when Hamlet died, and it
is the same death that will come to
you and me—the end will be just as
sudden, whether we fall in the mid-day
of life or fall to the slow fever of age.
They fell but ten feet apart and I walked
up and looked down on them—the proud,
beautiful creatures now limp and lifeless.</p>

<p>I took them up and fondled them—I
wanted to kiss them, they were so quiet
now and warm, still splendid in death.</p>

<p>Mr. Stone had killed his brace also, but
being more experienced, had shot them
farther off.</p>

<p>“You killed yours too close,” he said,
as I stood fondling the limp and beautiful
birds. “You should have waited up to
fifty yards or seventy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “you see it is my quail
hunting instinct. I had my first lesson
in shooting quail in the pine woods of
Alabama, and let me tell you, I laughed,
it may be wrong, but it’s dead easy killing
those big, beautiful hens. Honestly,
except for their lightning flight I thought
I was shooting at Tennessee guineas.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stone laughed: “You wait and
see,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, if you want to know what real
shooting is,” I went on, “you just get
up a covey of piny wood quail, where
every mother’s chick of them is taught
from his pipping moment to place a pine
tree between him and a load of shot, and
do it in the first twenty feet. You have
got to shoot quick.”</p>

<p>We had walked away across the stubble
to where they had gone down, scattered.
Suddenly—</p>

<p>“There they are,” said my companion.
As we came on the bitch frozen again.</p>

<p>“Now, you first,” said Mr. Stone,
kindly, “it’s a single bird.”</p>

<p>Up went the bird with his thunder of
wings. I don’t know how it happened—I
can’t see how it happened to this
day. I think I was thinking of Alabama
quail or Tennessee “patterges,” as Old
Wash calls them, but when I fired and
the great game cock went on about his
business, I got busy seeing what ailed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
my gun, and wondering why we always
fall down about the time we think we
are mounted on as many legs as a centipede.
Mr. Stone was too polite to refer
to my previous remarks, and I watched
the big fellow sail away with more respect
for the sport.</p>

<p>A little further on the Llewellyn again
stood, and this time it was my companion’s
first shot. And here is where I
did a shameless thing—but I couldn’t
help it, to save my life.</p>

<p>Up went the bird, and I saw the old
hunter throw up his gun. I listened for
the report, but on sailed the bird, fairly
eating space—on—on—fifty—sixty—seventy
yards.</p>

<p>My fingers itched, my arms jerked
upward, my gun jumped to my shoulder.
“Great heavens,” I thought, “the
bird is gone! His gun won’t fire”—</p>

<p>The report of my gun and the collapse
of the bird came just a second before his.</p>

<p>He looked around astonished. “Pray
forgive me,” I said. “I have acted the
hog, but I was sure something was the
matter with your gun.”</p>

<p>He laughed: “I was just waiting for
it to get a little farther away.”</p>

<p>After that I shot them farther off, and
by noon we had eleven beauties, filling
up the front of our surrey, upon which my
eye feasted in delight.</p>

<p>We decided we had enough, and towards
evening we drove across the
cooling, sweet grasses to a group of
pretty little lakes or ponds in the hollow
depression of the land. These we found
literally covered with Spoonbills, Teal,
Mallard and Red-heads, and then we had
sport royal and of another kind. They
were wary, though, very; and we had to
crawl on our stomach for a quarter of a
mile to get to them, Mr. Stone on the
far side, to fire first and send them over
me. And when his gun sounded once,
twice, here they came toward me, I
lying flat in the grass. I picked two
big ones leading the flock, knowing if
I didn’t get the kings I’d get the knights
and pawns behind them. I didn’t get
the king, but down tumbled a Red-head,
a Mallard—one—two—three—four! Good
heaven! Did I kill all of them? I
saw smoke drifting across my left. Mr.
Stone had turned his old Winchester repeater
on them, also, and so I gave
him credit for everything but the redhead,
for I shot at him. This was our
sport—from one lake to another, until
we had shot enough, and the ride home
across the starlit prairies and under the
cool, bracing air of that boundless, glorious
country.</p>

<p>Can you not see how two days of that
kind of sport is worth all drunken yacht
trips, and all the heart-breaking, dust-killing
automobile rides in the world?
You feel it bodily and spiritually for
years, and remember it with pleasure all
your life.</p>

<p>So here’s to the grand Dakotas and
their hospitable people and their splendid
birds!</p>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">E. I. Woodfin, of Alabama</span></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">There is no subject which is of more
vital interest to the South and to
the whole world than successful cotton culture.
In spite of the repeated claims to
the contrary, in which every now and
then it is predicted that certain areas in
Africa, India, China and South America
will be devoted to cotton, the fact remains
that that strip of country lying
on the map of the Southern part of the
United States is the finest cotton belt
in the world, and so far absolutely the
only large body of land that has ever
produced year in and out any very great
amount of the fleece. That it will continue
to be the world’s field for cotton for
centuries remains clearly proven, not only
because of its adaptability but because
upon it live an intelligent and industrious
branch of the great white race, to guide
and direct and work and this race of people
have the best labor in the world to
assist—the negro.</p>

<p>In the early days this great cotton plantation,
as the South might almost be
called, suffered greatly from careless and
improvident cultivation in which the rich
soil lost much that might have been kept
in it. The great thing now is to reclaim
and build up and at the same time produce
cotton for the steadily increasing
demand, which is more as each year goes
by. With these preliminary remarks, and
the further one that I cannot better illustrate
my subject than to quote my own
personal experience and with apology for
the personal tenor of this paper, I shall
give to others the benefits of my limited
success.</p>

<p>However, in every profession of life,
each aspirant strives for golden results,
and as I feel that my harvests for the
past few years have increased several
fold, perhaps the practical farmer may
benefit some one.</p>

<p>In 1895 I purchased my farm containing
about 200 acres. At that time the
natural resources of the soil were almost
completely exhausted, the produce from
one acre being about one-third of a bale
when planted to cotton. I realized there
was no money from so small a yield as
that so determined first to try to restore
the impoverished soil—the soil which for
fifty years had been planted in cotton.
The clean culture that cotton requires
had exhausted the humus from the soil,
and it’s almost impossible to make any
money on cotton grown on such soil. I
decided that rotation of crops was the
best and cheapest way of restoring this
soil. I divided my land into four fields,
fencing each field with wire. No. 1 I used
for a permanent pasture. No. 2 I planted
in cotton. No. 3 half in corn, the other
half in oats, followed by peas. No. 4 I
used as a temporary pasture, thereby giving
the soil a much needed rest. Don’t
be afraid to do this; the cattle and hogs
sold from it will pay you some rent, and
in the improvement of your land lies
the increase of your bank account. Having
started this rotation, I have kept
it up, letting cotton follow corn and oats,
corn and oats follow temporary pasture,
and pasture following cotton. Could you
see the result you would say with me that
rotation is the keynote to successful cotton
culture. Occasionally a farmer will
have the seasons very favorable and
make a good crop on land deficient in
humus, but what we are striving for is
to make a paying crop every year. This
restoration of humus is a wonderful safeguard
against excessive wet or dry weather.
Stable manure supplies this much-wanted
humus, but our supply is very
limited; from the number of stock required
to work this amount of land we
get only enough to cover three or four
acres. But we farmers have to acquire
patience, anyway. Take your field that
has been planted in corn, oats and peas,
as soon as the stock has finished up what
the mower left (we save all the pea
vines we can for feed). Now, turn under
all stubble with a two-horse plow. If this
is well done, it will decompose before
planting time, if you finished with the
plowing early enough, thereby adding
much humus to the soil, as well as nitrogen
stored there by the pea crop. The
custom is to break this land flat, but
I prefer to lay mine off in beds from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
first. My land is now bedded, and it is
about time to commence planting. My
fertilizer distributor is started about two
days ahead of my cotton planter. The
fertilizer is put in drill not over three or
four inches deep, and is to be followed
by a harrow. Now, get the best cotton
seed. I use what I consider the best. I
won’t tell you of its many good qualities
for fear you will think this an advertisement.
After the cotton has come up to
a good stand, start the plows to barring
it off. As soon as you have finished
barring put on little sweeps and run close
to the plants. This leaves them on a
very narrow ridge and a good hand will
chop from one to one-half acres more per
day than he would on a bar. Push the
chopping, and follow immediately, if possible,
with plows, dirting the cotton up
with sweeps. In ten days’ time, or less,
if it rains, go over again with hoes, taking
out every other hill and putting it to
a stand. These two workings with the
hoe will cost very little more than to
have put it to a stand at first and the cotton
will be in much better shape. Strive
to plow over every ten days until you
see the first open boll. Guard against
plowing too wet. After rains wait until
the soil crumbles. In cultivating I use a
double foot with two 14-inch sweeps, going
twice to the row, until the first of
July. After that I use a 28 or 30-inch
wing sweep. I generally go over my
crop with the hoes twice after it is put
to a stand. In dry seasons once is generally
sufficient. By all means keep
ahead of the grass. It will injure your
cotton and cost you more in the end to
clean it out. You see my advice is to
rotate. Come, walk over my fields with
me and see my cotton, in places growing
more than a bale per acre, where a few
years ago the yield was about one-fourth
of a bale, and you will say with me,
“Help nature, give her back her natural
elements, and she will return you a
harvest of gold.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Poetry_True_and_False">Poetry, True and False</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">John Trotwood Moore</span></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">There have been many definitions
of poetry ranging all the way from
the well-known Englishman’s definition,
“A criticism of human life,” to that
given by one of the most original
of all poets, Poe, “the rhythmical creation
of beauty.” That was merely as these
two men saw it, or had the poetic principle
developed in them—the first, practically;
the second in all the rythmical
beauty and sensuousness and indefinable
mistiness of the immortal “Raven.”</p>

<p>It is quite plain that no definition can
be given of poetry that would apply to
all poetry or even to the poetic principle.
No more than can be given a definition
of love, or the sweet character of the
Christ, or of God, or of eternity. Each
true poem, like the keys of a piano,
may awake a different chord, and
every one perfect. To attempt to define
the poetic principle would be like attempting
to sound the depths of our immortal
souls, the very spirit of eternal
life, a depth as varied as humanity—in
some, as deep as the valleys in the
ocean’s bed, in other “ending in shallows
and in miseries.” I believe it was Mendelssohn
who said there were two things
mortal man should not attempt to define—“God
Almighty and Thorough-Base-and-Harmony.”</p>

<p>Poetry is the music of the intellect and,
therefore, like the musical principle, is
indefinable. But what are some of its
attributes?</p>

<p>First of all, real poetry is true, and absolutely
a part of our souls, our experience,
ourselves, our most positive beliefs.
At first it may not be readily understood
by us—a fact in itself which should warn
us not to be too hasty in condemning it,
because that very fact may show it has
touched on a higher, not a lower plane
than the plane we are on, and that we
must climb to it, not drag it down to
us. Such is the poetry of Keats, Tennyson,
Shelley and Browning. And you
who say you cannot read poetry, and
who have had your taste destroyed for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
true poetry by newspaper jingle, which
lies at one extreme, and magazine poetry,
which lies at the other, and both of which
are more often false than true, let me
ask you before you give up, to read some
of the real poetry from each of the
authors above before saying again that
you cannot love poetry. Read Keats’
“The Eve of St. Agnes,” Tennyson’s “The
Princess,” Shelley’s “To a Skylark,” and
Longfellow’s “Evangeline.” In these, as in
all true poetry, though all of it may not
be fully grasped at first, there is an indefinable
something that touches us and
makes us wish to read it again and again
until, having tuned our own souls to
the key of its beauty we stand elevated,
instructed, sweetened, strengthened,
blessed!</p>

<p>The true poem, like the true poet, has
a mission to perform and should go right
to the heart of it—no beating around the
bush, no mental pyrotechnics, no flowery
words to sweeten and weaken it, no
“churning about to get up a foam,” no
intellectual mistiness, but the simple laying
of the hands on the eyes of the blind!
For every poet is also a preacher, and the
greatest of all preachers. And if it fails
to perform its mission, if it does not
sound its chord, and that clearly, but a
mere jingling of pretty bells, it is no
more a poem than a dancing harem girl,
with silver bells, bracelets and anklets
on her, is a woman. Every poem that
has ever lived lived because it filled a
mission; and all those that have died,
died because they had none to fill. “The
Psalm of Life,” “Highland Mary,” “Evelyn
Hope,” “Thanatopsis”—these and
hundreds of others, short as they are,
came with a mission and, finding it, performed
it, and each of the above, with
the lesson it teaches, is a statue in the
temple of fame and will stand there for
all times as clearly and distinctly as
Washington, Bruce, Nelson or Jackson.</p>

<p>Let us not judge poetry, then, by the
two false extremes in which we meet it
most often—newspapers and magazines—and
the two which have caused so
many to form unfavorable opinions of
poetry. Forgetting that rhyme is not
poetry, and that a poem is the product of
life, the newspaper poet tries to jingle
one out every day. He might as well try
to live his year in a day! Clipped by
some thoughtless editor, who uses his
shears as recklessly as he does his spleen,
and who clips as he writes—to fill space—the
newspaper poet mistakes even this
for ephemeral fame and like a howling
dervish continues to dance around the
circle to the monotonous music of his
tom-tom; while the magazine fellow,
after months of laborious travail, brings
forth an intellectual mouse. Posterity
will indict the first of these for false
pretenses, and hang the other for downright
murder. But like the thief and the
murderer of old, the punishment of one
will not bring back the good opinion of
poetry to those from whom he has filched
it, nor will the lynching of the other give
back to the world the life of Art after
the murderer has taken it.</p>

<p>Imagine Robert Burns, having made a
reputation with his “Highland Mary,” and
filled with the newspaper’s idea of his
art, grinding out another poem every
few days to the Scotch lassie his genius
immortalized. Posterity would hate him.
Think of Shelley, for ten dollars a week,
“trying his hand again on the ‘Skylark.’”
And yet this is what many so-called
modern newspaper poets try to do.</p>

<p>The truth is, the true poet, like the
mocking bird, never sings twice on the
same note, but in that song he exhausts
his soul. It is only the jaybird who
sings the same thing every day and imagines
it is a new song.</p>

<p>I do not mean by the above criticism
that real genius may not now and then
appear in newspapers. In fact, more of
it—much more—appears there than in
magazines, being often the bursting of
a wild rose in the meadow into full
bloom and giving its perfume to the
world without pay and without knowledge
of its own sweetness. But as the
wild rose cannot bloom every day in the
year, so have I never yet seen two newspaper
gems in one year by the same
poet. And those that appear, written
quickly, and apparently thoughtlessly,
yet are they the product of years of
sweet growth of unconscious development,
of work, imperceptibly wrought
out, but, like the coral castle beneath the
sea, as perfect and as beautiful.</p>

<p>But as between the newspaper and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
magazine poet, give me the former—for
now and then he writes a poem, but
the magazine poet—seldom! The first-named
is often a true poet, and
my only objection to him is that
he lowers the standard of his art, he
desecrates his high calling by a too
often, too feeble, and a too familiar
attempt; but the magazine poems, after
years of reading them, I am constrained
to believe that, with few exceptions, they
are utterly devoid of even the poetic principle.
Their authors not only would not
know a poem if they met one in the road,
but they could not read one if an angel
of light would write it with a diamond-pointed
star on the windows of heaven!</p>

<p>Poetry need not rhyme, it need not be
written in verse, even; and the simple
test of it all is, does it awaken some
chord in you that uplifts?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="With_Old_Wash">With Old Wash.</h2>

<h3>THE EXAMINATION.</h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Boss,” said Old Wash the other
night, “I have got ter hol’ a zamination
over in my deestrick for skule
teecher, an’ I wisht you’d write out de
questions for me.”</p>

<p>I knew that the old man was the moving
spirit in educational and religious
matters in his end of the county and
that he holds an examination now and
then among the colored applicants, and
none of them may teach or preach unless
the old man passes on their papers.</p>

<p>After much work I wrote a list of questions
suitable, as I thought, for such an
occasion and read them to the examiner.</p>

<p>“Deys all right, boss, ’cept one thing.
Jes write de answers dar, too. It’s a po’
teecher dat ain’t got his ansers as well
as his questuns. An’ I’d lak for you ter
go along, too, jes ter see me squelch dem
smart Ike niggers dat think dey kno’s it
all.”</p>

<p>On the day appointed there were three
applicants. One was a pompous looking
darky with a knack of saying things
grandly and using big words. I named
him Pompey. Number two was a sanctimonious
looking fellow who knew it all.
He was a newly fledged preacher. Number
three was a knowing-looking, sly soon,
with less book sense, but more mother
wit than the others. He looked like a
slick one.</p>

<p>Nothing pleased the old man more than
to show off his own learning and he
quickly caught on to Pompey’s gait—going
him, in fact, one better. Slowly
and with great dignity he pulled out his
roll of manuscript, adjusted his big, iron-rimmed
spectacles, and squelched them
all in the beginning with the flow of
language:</p>

<p>“Now, I’m gwine ax you all a few supernumerous
questions, calk’lated to disembody
de fundermentalerties of yore
onderstandin’ an’ de posserbilerties of
yore interlects for impartin’ informashun.
An’ I want you all to chirp right out as
peart as jay-birds on a Friday.”</p>

<p>There is a negro superstition to the
effect that all jay-birds go to a place unmentionable
on Friday and carry sand to
his Satanic majesty. I wondered If it
was a hint of what the old man had
coming for them.</p>

<p>Adjusting his glasses again, the old man
said to the preacher:</p>

<p>“Whut is jog’erfy?”</p>

<p>The answer came back glibly and without
a flaw:</p>

<p>“Jog’erfy is de science of de earth an’
de art of navergashun.”</p>

<p>This was said in such a matter of fact,
positive tone that I almost caught my
breath. But I soon learned that all their
answers, right or wrong, came with the
same assurance and without a quiver.
The old man squinted one eye and said:</p>

<p>“Den I s’pose you’d say a coon-dog was
de science ob coon-killin’ an’ de art ob
barkin’. I turns you down on dat.
Nex’!”</p>

<p>“Jog’erfy,” said Pompey, “Jog’erfy!
Brer Washington, ain’t dat got sumpin’
to do sorter lak a narrer neck jinin’ two
dem-johns of lan’, sorter lak an’ so forth
or sumpin lak it?”</p>

<p>“Wal, it may smell ob de jug a leetle,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
said the old man, “but it don’t gine de
demi-john to de extent ob pullin’ out de
cork. Nex’.”</p>

<p>“Jog’erfy,” said the Slick One, “is de
art ob joggin’ and de science ob gwine
round circles.”</p>

<p>This set the old man to thinking. He
scratched his head and inspected the
candidate closely. “Ain’t you de nigger
dat use ter swipe old Hal P’inter when
he went to de races?”</p>

<p>“Yassir.”</p>

<p>“Wal, dat ain’t zactly right, but it’s
got mo’ sense in it dan anything dat’s
been sed, an’ I’ll give you ten, as you
seem to have sum hoss sense in yore
make-up.”</p>

<p>Fortunately I was where I could lean
back behind the blackboard and save the
dignity of the examination. For all this
had been said with a dignity and earnestness
that was appalling, and not the
slightest trace of humor appeared in their
voices.</p>

<p>“How am Tennessee bounded?” he
asked Pompey.</p>

<p>“She’s bounded by straight lines makin’
a parallellogram inclinin’ in a right
angle,” said Pompey, knowingly.</p>

<p>The old man scratched his jaw and
passed it to the Preacher. The answer
came back glibly:</p>

<p>“Tennessee am bounded on de north
by Kaintucky an’ de rory-bory Alice, on
de east by de Great Smoky mountains, on
the west by Mt. Pelee an’ on de south—”</p>

<p>The old man brought his fist down indignantly.
“Ef we’re bounded on all dem
sides by de things you say dar ain’t but
one thing dat can nachully bind us on de
south an’ dat am hell! You may know
a whole lot about dat place but you don’t
kno’ a little bit about jog’erfy. Lemme
see whut you all kno’ ’bout hist’ry.”</p>

<p>He slowly studied out the next question:</p>

<p>“Relate de causes leadin’ to de Riverlushunary
war.”</p>

<p>“De circumnavigatin’ cause ob de
Riverlushunary war,” said Pompey glibly,
“was de extenshun ob de Equater too
far into de Gulf stream, endangerin’ de
tail ob de British Umpire.”</p>

<p>The old man sadly shook his head and
passed it to the Swipe.</p>

<p>“I can’t jes zactly spress it kordin’ to
book larnin’,” said the Swipe, “but it was
sorter lak dis: We drawed de pole an’
axed for a squar race, but England fouled
us on de fus’ turn an’ got us in a
pocket on’ de half. We run into her,
cut her down an’ won as we pleased.”</p>

<p>“Go head,” said the old man proudly.
“Hal P’inter sho’ done lamed you sumpin’.”</p>

<p>This put the Swipe at the head. He
scratched his chin, made eyes at the
others and licked out his tongue.</p>

<p>“Who was Maj. Andre?” slowly spelled
out the old man.</p>

<p>The Preacher thought he was one of
the Disciples and Pompey, after much
thought, said he was the man who went
over Niagara in a barrel. The Swipe
wasn’t sure, but after a while his face
lit up with a broad smile and he said:</p>

<p>“Unc. Wash, wan’t he a British ringer
dat got unkivered an’ ruled off at de
West P’int meetin’? ’Twas a close heat
an’ he lost by a neck.”</p>

<p>“De very man,” said the old man enthusiastically.
“I tell you, sonny, if you
keep up dis clip, you’ll break in all de
colts in dis deestrick.” The Swipe smiled
and sat up higher in the sulky. The old
man studied his manuscript carefully and
propounded:</p>

<p>“Describe de battle ob Shiloh.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s easy,” said the Preacher smiling.
“It was a hard-fit fight in which
Shiloh got killed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he did,” said the old man, wrathfully.
“I guess de nex’ thing you’ll be
tryin’ to teach de ole man dat at de battle
ob de Nelson, de Nile fell offen his
hoss. Nex’, whut you say?”</p>

<p>“Dat ar battle wus a dead heat ’twixt
Gen. Grant an’ Johnsing, wan’t it, Unc.
Wash?”</p>

<p>“Sonny,” said the old man proudly,
“I’m beginnin’ to think I orter resign an’
let you ax dese questions. I didn’t kno’
dar was so much hoss sense in hist’ry.”</p>

<p>“What am de princerpal organ ob circulation?”
spelled out the old man.</p>

<p>Pompey thought a long time and
thought it was the liver. The Preacher
threw up his hand and a knowing smile
went over his face.</p>

<p>“What am it, den?” asked the teacher.</p>

<p>“De hat,” shouted the candidate.</p>

<p>“Es dat’s de fust time you’ve come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
nigh it I’ll give you ten on dat,” said the
old man, “but I think de P’inter boy can
do better yet.”</p>

<p>“De princerpal organ ob circulashun,”
said the Swipe, “am de little silver cartwheel
dat is stamped wid de eagle.”</p>

<p>“Sunny,” said the old man, “you have
sho’ been in de hoss bisness for some
good. Now you Preacher man, whut was
de greatest trade of England?”</p>

<p>“De trade-wind,” came back promptly.</p>

<p>“Trade yore grandmammy’s black cat,”
said the old man, wrathfully. “What
wind got to do wid dis deestrick skule?
You ’pear to be mighty windy yo’se’f.
Nex’.”</p>

<p>“Wan’t dat de Pennsylvania whisky
resurrecshun’?” timidly asked Pompey.</p>

<p>The old man glared at him. The Swipe
held up his hand, and when the old man
nodded, he said:</p>

<p>“De princerpal trade, Unc. Wash?
’Pears to me it was when ole Richard
tried to trade his kingdom for a good
hoss.”</p>

<p>“Wal,” said the old man, “tain’t down
zactly dat way in my book, but I’m
gwine give you de certificate, fur it
’pears lak you de only nigger on dat
bench dat’s got enny hoss sense an’ dat’s

<h2 class="nobreak" id="And_Who_Is_My_Neighbor">“And Who Is My Neighbor?” Luke 10:29</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Rev. T. A. Wharton</span>, D.D., First Presbyterian Church, Columbia, Tenn.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">He was a Pharisee. He was also a
scribe—a lawyer. And he stood
up to tempt the Master. He would show
this throng gathered about the Lord that
their alleged prophet was only a cheap
schemer—a designing Galilean playing
upon their ignorance and credulity.</p>

<p>“Rabbi (patronizingly), what shall I do
to inherit eternal life?” Let us reason
together and come to first principles:
What do you make of the primal law?
Just the old question of the Pharisee—the
classic question of the legalist in
every age of the world. There is a double
blunder in this age-worn question.
They belong to that class of blunders
which have just enough truth in their
midst to give them a species of eternal
life, and self perpetuative power.</p>

<p>The first blunder is an assumption—that
in doing alone depends an entrance
into the kingdom of heaven. What shall
I do—what shall I do? Never what
shall I be? It is so much easier to do
than to be—that it is not a thing for
wonder that our poor warped human nature
should prefer to beat out a path
of merit and morals to the kingdom
rather than submit the will. “Do this
and live” is its password and shibboleth—never
the “live and do this” of the
Master.</p>

<p>“Ye must be born again” is something
alike repulsive to the pride of reason and
the pride of life. And yet there is nothing
more certain than this—no one of
us shall ever see the kingdom of God
without such a radical birth change in
our heart of hearts as shall give all our
doing a new meaning and color. Is it
not a strange blunder for man to make
when it appears in the very question itself?
We cannot do things to inherit—we
must be sons to inherit.</p>

<p>The second blunder is an assumption
also. It appears in the tone of the questioner.
The tone implies, Rabbi, am I
not doing enough already? Am I not
doing all that is necessary. I give alms
of all that I possess. I fast twice in the
week. My life is clean in the sight of
the law—“Thank God, I am not as other
men are”—as that disciple of yours there,
for instance. What further shall I do
or can I do to inherit eternal life? What
lack I yet or the existing church of God?
In so far as you are teaching anything
new it must be false, and anything old
is it not unnecessary? Why then all
this stir you are making throughout the
land?</p>

<p>The Master’s reply is very simple. He
takes this self-sufficient sinner on his
own ground: “How readest thou the
law?” Since this is your trust and hope,
what do you make of it? The lawyer
replies glibly enough: “Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with all thy heart,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
with all thy soul, with all thy might and
with all thy strength, and thy neighbor
as thy self.” The Saviour replies:
“Thou hast answered right; do this and
thou shalt live.” But there is such an
emphasis upon the “do” this that a dead
silence falls. The lawyer grows uncomfortable,
and begins to hedge. Had he
this “done?” But it is evident that the
less said upon the first table of the law
the better. There is more hope of the
second. So says the record: “And willing
to justify himself, he asks,” “And who
is my neighbor?” Do you not see that
this is a broken sentence? It is preceded
by a bit of very hurried thinking. I have
been good to my family—to those about
me—my next of kin—my set. It all depends
upon this “who is my neighbor.”
“And who is my neighbor?”</p>

<p>The answer is only a parable, but a
parable whose meaning when once caught
and practiced shall change our world
beyond the recognition of even the angels
of heaven. It will make this poor, weary,
burdened earth to blossom as the rose;
shall make all our desert like the garden
of the Lord. It shall become the universal
solvent for all problems arising from
man’s relation to man. It will stop every
war before noon to-morrow.</p>

<p>Then shall the lion of capital and the
lamb of labor lie down together, and
neither shall be afraid, neither shall
there be any more strikes, nor walking
delegates; no more epidemics of hate;
no more vipers to hiss their slander or
trail their slime. “Then shall every battle
flag be furled in the parliament of
nations, the federation of the world.”</p>

<p>Wherever there lies the wounded and
helpless by the wayside of life, wheresoe’er
in the world there shall spring
to the rescue some strong son of God
armed to the teeth with wine and oil
for the wound and the sword of the
Lord and of Gideon for the assassin,
our right worshipful dollar shall change
its meaning and its face—its eagle shall
have the olive branch in its mouth. It
shall become a health certificate for the
sick, a help certificate for the needy,
even though they be not our next of kin.</p>

<p>This parable has wrapt up in it the
one remedy for the race with which to
work out its salvation from man’s inhumanity
to man.</p>

<p>Oh, this is a dream, the over statement
of an enthusiast’s heated fancy. If it be
so, then farewell to our hope of civilization.
Its permanence will depend upon
its obedience to this, its supreme law.
It is no dream. Everywhere before your
very eyes is it unfolding—unfolding an
asylum for the helpless, hospitals for the
sick, charitable institutions of every type
are reaching out their arms all over the
world for earth’s stricken ones—its motherless
and helpless. You pessimists do
not believe in humanity, nor do I, but
I believe in humanity’s Christ, and I
know He is breathing into His own utterance
the law that is to redeem the whole
earth. “Thou shalt love thy neighbor
as thyself.”</p>

<p>And who is my neighbor? We have
been saying all the time with this narrow
Jewish lawyer, He is my fellow-Jew;
he is akin to me—a man of my nation,
and my neighborliness, diminishing with
the square of the distance, vanishing altogether
when he is out of sight.</p>

<p>Well, I tell you, this is not the Master’s,
although very similar. His definition has
just two definite terms, and two only—a
certain man, and, to die unless someone
helps him. A nameless man of a
nameless land, and wholly desperate. All
else is indefinite—a certain man. Was
he a Jew? No answer. Was he stranger
from the Perean hills beyond Jordan?
No answer. Was he a merchantman
from the isles of the sea returning with
his Damascus purchases via Jerusalem
and Joppa? No answer. Was he a good
man? No answer. A man of means,
or poor, with a dependent family? No
answer. Was it not wrong of him to venture
through so dangerous a region, and
alone? No answer. Was it not foolhardy
of him not to yield his goods and
without a struggle? No answer.</p>

<p>All that enters into the Saviour’s definition
is the fact that he was a man,
a helpless, wounded man, and to die<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
unless someone comes to him and ministers
to his desperate need.</p>

<p>Now, here is the definition and the picture
of our neighbor, a picture whose

the world shall last. This is the man
whom Jehovah solemnly committed to
his people in every age of His church.
O land of Pharisees, O scribe and lawyer,
ever since the days of Abel this
man has been your charge and ward.
How sayest thou, I have loved my neighbor
as myself? How sayest thou, I have
kept the commandment of God, when
thou has walled thyself off in national
barriers and hath built walls of caste
and prejudice between thyself and him?
How sayest thou, I have loved my neighbor
as myself, when thou hast stopped
thine ears and shut thine eyes and
stalked on by all those who are lying
by the wayside of the Kingdom, dying
through all these years of your history
and theirs?</p>

<p>This is our neighbor, where are his?
We have found him, where shall he find
his neighbor? The story of the Good
Samaritan is the eternal answer.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Now Tomlinson once robbed a man in Berkeley Square,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a copper caught him in the act and nabbed him then and there.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The copper grabbed him by the neck and hurried him away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a blue patrol that was right outside, he rode through shadows gray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To a gloomy place in the darksome town where the blatant noises cease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they came to a gate within a wall where the jailer has the keys.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Stand up, stand up, now Tomlinson, and answer loud and high.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your name and age, and all of that and ye need not ask me why.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The morning dawned and before the judge to trial came Tomlinson,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He sentenced him to the gloomy “Pen,” and a year he got—just one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the judge’s voice resounding loud to him seemed like a knell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or ever they took the man away to lock him in his cell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Tomlinson looked up and down and sought for things to read:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“A yellow journal is my meat, yea, that is what I need,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I will crawl upon my knees and ask the jailer man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he will only bring to me a sheet of the hue of tan.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the jailer held his hands aloft and swore by heaven high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That no such evil thing should come that penitentiary nigh;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“For by my troth,” the jailer cried, “ye are a devilish mess,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ye dare not steep your guilty soul in the filth of the saffron press.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now Tomlinson gave up the ghost in the penitentiary there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spirit gripped him by the hair and sun by sun they fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till they came to the belt of wicked stars that rim the mouth of hell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The devil sat behind the bars where the desperate legions drew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And spied the hasting Tomlinson and gladly let him through:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sit down, sit down, upon the slag and yammer loud and high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tell me what you did, my man, or ever ye came to die.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“I spent my time on earth, my lord, in reading the yellow press.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus Tomlinson let out his voice and shouted in distress.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then the devil gripped him by the hair, and redder grew his face:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“If that be true, ye dare not spend one minute in this place;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wot ye the price of good pit coal that I must pay?” asked he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“That ye rank yourself so fit for hell and ask no leave of me?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go back to earth with lip unsealed—go back with an open eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And carry my word to the sons of men, or ever ye come to die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the readers of the yellow press on earth may bide and dwell.</div>

<p>Here is a letter from a young man in
Wisconsin, one whom I have never met
except in that way in which kindred
spirits so often meet—by mail. Stricken
ere his manhood had scarcely begun,
blind, he has never given up, and is
making a living and doing good to all
around him—one of the best and most
useful citizens of his town.</p>

<p>Trotwood believes in this whole country,
North and South. He does not believe
that either section has all the good
or all the bad, but that in both there
is far more good than evil and that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
only reason why people do not like each
other is because they do not know each
other. Transportation, the cable, the
telegraph, wireless telegraphy and the
telephone have changed the face of the
world and corralled mankind with wires
of steel. Japan is nearer Washington to-day
than Boston was fifty years ago. You
have more neighbors in Europe than your
grandfather had in the county adjoining
him. I am publishing this letter hoping
my blind friend may find the kind surgeon,
and also to show the spirit of our
reunited country for which my pen has
always and will ever work to cement:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">Merrill, Wis., June 30, 1905.</p>

<p>Dear Trotwood: Rather tardy in
thanking you for taking the trouble of
sending me “Songs and Stories of Tennessee,”
but my wife and daughter have
been away on a visit and though it’s
vacation, this is the first opportunity
I’ve had to press my sister into service.
We all enjoyed the stories very much,
and are looking forward eagerly to the
time when your new book will be out.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to tell you of my
father’s experience during the Civil War,
to see what you think of it, and to see
if you have any idea who the surgeon
could have been and to show you another
family in the North with the kindliest
of feelings for the people of the
South.</p>

<p>July 1, ’63, at about 2 o’clock p.m., a
Confederate bullet laid my father low
at the Battle of Gettysburg. The ball
passed through and killed the man directly
in front of him, entering father
below the heart, the wound being very
similar to that of President Garfield.
He still carries the lead. He lay the
afternoon until along in the evening the
Union line having retreated, and firing
ceased. About this time Gen. Lee and
his staff came on the field. The general,
seeing father was alive, asked what
troops he had fought and how boys happened
to get commissions in the Northern
Army. Father answered, “They
fought and earned them.” As the party
passed on, the surgeon returned, eased
father’s position, gave him a drink of
liquor and said he would see him later.
He came again at about nine o’clock
that night, twice the next day and late
the afternoon of July 2 he had two Confederate
soldiers prepare a litter and
carry father to a farm house where,
being the most dangerously wounded, he
was given the only mattress in the house.
Father calls him his “Good Samaritan.”
During his time on the field his hat cord
was stolen and he gave all the money he
had, twenty dollars, ten each to two
Union soldiers to get him off the field or
get him something to drink. They never
returned. During the night a Confederate
soldier gave him a drink of milk for
which he had spent his last cent. This
is in brief, but explicit enough to show
that though father was struck down by
a Confederate bullet he nevertheless
owes his life to men of that army. When
the Confederate line retreated, father
was taken to the hospital in the city and
was never able to learn the name of his
“Good Samaritan.” How his wound did
not heal for two years, how Dr. Bliss
treated him and how an abscess formed
in his back which also took a long time
to heal is probably but a repetition of
many such incidents of which you’ve already
heard.</p>

<p>For fear you’ll grow weary, I’ll desist.</p>

<p class="center">Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="right">H. R. BRUCE.</p>

<p>It is time that the flamboyant and
flowery, the unreal, was cut out of our
oratory and literature. Kill it. Talk
straight, think straight, live straight.
The flamboyant, the flowery is the
product of slavery, of idleness, of
high living and no thinking. It is a relic
of the past, of feudalism, a mixture of
chivalry and unclear thinking. The great
poet, the great writer, the great orator
is he who talks the greatest good sense.
Anything else is the badge of mediocrity.
The tendency of everything these strenuous
days, from literature to life insurance,
is expressed in the phrase: “Get
there.” How amusing the efforts of a
Tennessee statesman in a recent great
occasion, majestically sweeping the
heavens with his hands and solemnly
proclaiming that “Tennessee had set
more stars in the galaxy of glory than all
the other States.” Bosh! Tennessee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
has as many fools to the acre as any other
State, and what she should do just now
is to set more hens and fewer stars!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>People who live with nature soon learn
a great deal. The best way to study
nature is to get in harmony with the
laws of nature. The best advice ever
given on longevity was from the cheerful
old gentleman who said: “To live
long, live naturally, eat what you want
and walk on the sunny side of the
street.” Children think that some
great man made up the horrid rules
of grammar, and then all the world
learned them and went to talking. They
do not know that the world talked first
and the rules of grammar were deduced
from the talking. From the facts of
life we draw our rules.</p>

<p>And Nature is the Great Fact.</p>

<p>I was thinking of one of her facts
the other day—she has so many thousands—but
I noticed it is a fact that
the man who works the soil is a natural-born
optimist. Let the farmer fail year
after year and he still plants, hoping.
Let the merchant fail one year and he
is badly shaken—one more—another,
maybe—and he is done. That is the
Fact. Now for the rule: God intended
man to love, to cultivate, to cling to the
soil. In other words, is not farming
man’s natural vocation, since neither
drought nor flood nor failure can shut
out from his heart that instinct of hoping
which has come down to him through
centuries of farming fathers?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We—and that means England and
America—have used the Jap to fight our
battles for us. The issue has been the
stopping of the tide of Moscovites across
Asia, the killing of their influence in the
East, the grasping from covetous hands
the yellow empire, richer than mints of
yellow gold to the nation that shall supply
their wants. That means the
open door until Japan decides to
close it for the world and that the
Muscovite must forever be bound between
the Baltic and the North Sea and
the ice zone of the Pacific, all of which
was necessary. Arrogant and ignorant
Russia needed this chastisement. But
is it not time to stop? We are chuckling
now, but the greatest problem
lies before us. Sixteenth century Russia
has met twentieth century Japan, and
walked from the woods of barbarity into
the daylight of a Mauser-swept, mine-entangled,
smokeless-plowed field of
death. The harvest has been as certain
as when the Gauls came out of the
woods to meet the steel-sheathed legions
of Caesar.</p>

<p>History does not stop at one page.
One was made at Port Arthur and the
Straits of Japan, now—</p>

<p>“Let China alone,” said Napoleon,
“she is a sleeping giant.” The fight has
been for China, and the wily Jap, playing
on the unfailing cupidity and conquering,
grabbing instinct of the Anglo-Saxon,
has won. Hereafter China belongs
to Japan. Give her just a century
to vitalize the nation which, if the world
were stood in a line, would count every
fourth fighter as hers, and the white
race will face the problem of its existence.
At Portsmouth recently, when the
Sabbath came, the Russian went to
church. The Jap only laughed, and voted
to work on. Shintoism knows no Sunday,
no soul, no to-morrow, no eternity.
Shintoism is blind chance pitched against
the barb-wire of blind unbelief.</p>

<p>It is time to see clearly—to turn. We
have conquered our own kin with a soulless,
smiling, ghost-born being who is
far-sighted and will yet make our children
wonder why we gave him a Mauser
for posterity. As for us, we will always
be for the white man and the Christian.</p>

<p>Trotwood’s Monthly has installed a
new feature in magazine management.
We call him Jonah. He is a bright boy
who does things around the editorial
room. They are not always done right,
but when he finishes with them we are
willing to aver that they are always
done. One of his duties is to read all of
the poetry submitted—and it is coming in
with a rush—condemn the bad and pass
the good up to Trotwood for final judgment.
Here are his comments on an
execrable batch of it sent in under the

this—“The Hal family is a very slow

with a Texas Mustang pretty soon, they
will only be fit for water wagons and apple

<p>When I learned that TROTWOOD
was to edit TROTWOOD’S MONTHLY I
folded my arms and shouted for joy, I
knew the author of “Ole Mistis” and
“Miss Kitty’s Funeral,” two of the

from the first number of TROTWOOD’S
MONTHLY I think we will get it. The
visitor from Tennessee is gladly welcomed,
bringing as it does into our home
good cheer and sunshine—short gems
of poetry, making “Tears from eyelids
start,” then smiles and ringing laughter.</p>

<p>With Little Sister, we grieve over the
condemned long-legged colt. We help
her to rescue the little deformed thing
from the hands of the negro executioner.
We shout and sing and dance and “’Rah
for Little Sister” at the race course as
she swings proudly into the ring and
wins the race.</p>

<p>Right gladly we renew our acquaintance
with “Old Wash” and our sympathies
are his as he attempts with his
luscious watermelons to reach the hearts
of his people through their stomachs,
and also defeats his own purpose through
their stomachs.</p>

<p>A “History of the Hals” appeals
strongly to lovers of fine horses. Many
horses of the Hal family are owned by
Texans and the articles on this especial
subject will be read with avidity by
subscribers over this state as well as
elsewhere. A bright magazine enjoyed
alike by every member of the household
we find TROTWOOD’S MONTHLY to be,
and “Barkis is more than willin’” that it
should be the success it so well deserves.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
